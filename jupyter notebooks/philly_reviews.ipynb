It’s not a regular tasting menu. It’s done the Williams way, which is as a pitch-perfect mix of luxury and fun. It’s flaky bite-size empanadas filled with pig’s head. It’s a mini buttermilk biscuit topped with beef tartare and osetra caviar. It’s a canelé — glistening a little with the lacquer of local beeswax, double-baked in a copper mold after the batter rests for three days—that comes with the check at the end of the meal. Paired with cocktails by Paul MacDonald, the decades-old restaurant reigns as one of the city’s best.',\n",

While we don’t have a code that gets you $25 off on a Jerome Brown jersey, we have put together a list of the best places in Rittenhouse, Midtown Village, Logan Square, and beyond. The lineup includes an amazing sandwich shop, a few tapas spots with wine lists longer than Broad St., and places where you can get incredible bowls of pasta. These 32 spots have you covered for every occasion, whether you’re just looking for a quick BEC or want to spend the cost of some Wells Fargo floor seats on a dry-aged steak for your birthday. ',\n",

But the location isn’t the only reason we keep telling everyone about this place—all eight sandwiches, served on homemade milk buns, have us murmuring “Hoo-dah” in our sleep. We typically go for the grilled swordfish topped with a spicy kimchi tartar sauce, and we always pair it with an order of fries that comes with a choice of southwest, dijonaise, sour cream and onion sauce, and that same kimchi tartar.',\n",

It’s also a popular spot for Jefferson doctors and med students during the week, so if you want to grab a phoagie (an eggplant sandwich with avocado, bean sprouts, and something called pho sauce that we’d eat on anything), you’re going to need to time your visit for right before their shift change.',\n",

There’s usually a wait, especially on the weekend, but it’s worth it for the dishes that range from grilled asparagus with truffles to a whole suckling pig. It’s also easy to spend a pretty absurd amount of money here, but you don’t have to.

We’re especially into the small plates, like the chicken katsu bao and kobe hot dog, which are all $6 or less during Happy Hour. And if you’re not into the vibe inside, you can get the whole Happy Hour menu out back at the Graffiti Bar, which is a lot less purple.',\n",
       " 'The best part about Ocean Prime is how accessible it is. You almost never have to make a reservation here, so if you’ve had a particularly bad day at work that will only be made better by consuming an entire steak by yourself, you should just grab a seat at the Ocean Prime bar. In addition to being one of the best-looking bars in the area, it also has one of the better cocktail menus—with things like a whiskey clover with honey water and rum punch with chocolate bitters.',\n",
       " \"Oloroso looks like a tapas place, and the way the menu is set up—with small plates and charcuterie dominating the menu—it seems like it should be a tapas place, but it definitely doesn’t feel like a tapas place. The service is more formal and you'll find well-dressed people on special occasion dates or client dinners. So it’s probably not the best place to show up unannounced with a few friends and get a little loud, but the small plates (especially the charred eggplant) are worth a visit next time you’re looking for a spot to take your boss in Midtown Village.\",\n",

It’s a creative powerhouse that has been topping “best restaurant” lists around the country since it opened in 2011, and everything it makes is entirely vegan. But being vegan isn’t what sets Vedge apart. What sets Vedge apart is the fact that they use being vegan as a fun little challenge for themselves to make things more interesting. Kind of like when you were little and got too good at jumping rope so you decided to add a second rope into the mix—just to see if you could do it. And, let us tell you, Vedge can double dutch better than any other place around.',\n",

At $150 per person, including more for wine pairings, a meal for two here will inevitably cost several hundreds of dollars. Definitely save it for a landmark birthday, or the anniversary of an Eagles’ Super Bowl win.

       " 'The half-moon-shaped mandoo dumplings at Seorabol Center City are deep-fried, packed with spicy kimchi and beef, and come with a sweet-salty-gently-spicy house dipping broth. The golden dumplings are so undeniably good that you’ll hit their buy 10 meals online and get one free promo faster than your snooze button on Monday morning.',\n",
       " 'Going for what you want, especially at breakfast time, can make all the difference between starting your day with another bowl of dry granola or a stack of something fluffy and buttery. And for us, an order of brown sugar ricotta Kubaneh toast from K’Far is more satisfying than finding a parking spot on Chestnut Street during our first trip around the block. Whether we’re stopping by the Israeli bakery and breakfast/lunch spot to dine-in or pick up, the scent of the sweet ricotta and warm blueberries is so unforgettable that we’d probably circle around 10 times just to get our hands on a few orders.',\n",
       " 'Friday Saturday Sunday is a small, two-story restaurant in Rittenhouse and at a glance, it’s just like all of the other contemporary American spots in the city. You’ll see at least one crudo on the menu, along with some pastas and a roasted chicken, and it has the same beige color scheme and plates that look like they’re handmade, but are actually from Crate & Barrel. But unlike most other places with similar menus, each dish at Friday Saturday Sunday is so perfectly executed that you’ll want to erase every other beef tartare and charred octopus you’ve ever eaten from your memory. Kind of like Matt Damon’s situation in The Bourne Identity, but ideally without the whole forgetting about your family and friends thing.',\n",
       " 'Talula’s Garden in Washington Square West is the kind of restaurant that serves delicious food and has a great patio, but it’s nothing revolutionary. And yet we find ourselves here often, especially sitting outside. They have a large, split-level brick patio covered in vines and string lights, and it’s the biggest reason that Talula’s is always more crowded in the summer. On any night over 65 degrees, it’s tough to get a table out here—but if you call ahead, you can make it happen.',\n",
       " 'Unlike their sister Rittenhouse restaurant, Vernick Fish would never be described as “cozy” or “quaint.” It’s on the ground floor of the newest Comcast Tower and the dining room looks like it belongs in a Versace Home catalog. Regardless, you could just as easily show up wearing jeans and a sweatshirt as you could in a full tuxedo and you wouldn’t feel out of place. If you’re down to eat a lot of seafood, Vernick Fish is the most enjoyable fancy restaurant in the city. It might not seem like the kind of place you can have a relaxing meal with a few friends, but that’s exactly what makes Vernick Fish so great. You could save it for an anniversary, treat it like an oyster bar where you can meet a few colleagues after work, or use it as the common ground for a double date with your in-laws.',\n",
       " 'If we made a flowchart on whether or not you should go to Harper’s Garden, it would have one simple question: Is it nice outside? If the answer is no, then there are a bunch of other places we’d recommend instead. But if the answer is yes, if the sun is shining and the temperature is 70 or above, then there’s only one place you should be going for a post-work glass of wine and a few small plates. And that place is Harper’s Garden.',\n",
       " 'Even though it just looks like another fancy Rittenhouse spot reserved for a rich aunt’s birthday, Spice Finch is actually the kind of place you can go for a casual weeknight dinner when you’re okay with spending a little extra money, drinking a $15 cocktail, and eating some really good Mediterranean food. The food here might surprise you as well. It’s just as expensive as any other special occasion spot in Rittenhouse, which is another reason we initially put it in the “only use in case of emergencies” box, but it’s mostly very good and gets better with every course.\\xa0']"
