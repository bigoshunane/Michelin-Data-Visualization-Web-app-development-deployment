In fact, this branch of the international chain has gone full-on Fifth Avenue, where even the ceiling is of cathedral-like proportions. The 16-seater cypress counter is the focus of the room and offers a luxe sushi experience—not unlike the staff who makes everyone feel special from start to finish.<br/>Here, particularly at lunch, you’ll find several Japanophiles satisfying their cravings by ordering ten or more pieces of nigiri before scurrying back to their offices. Some of the chefs are more engaging than others, but all work with the same practiced, fluid movements. At dinner, the omakase is a significant affair—reflected in the prices—where the itamae demonstrate their mastery over different seasonal fish. The koshihikari rice is yuki-tsubaki from the Niigata Prefecture and is seasoned with red vinegar, which makes it quite dark in color. Each piece is simply brushed with nikiri and occasionally some grated yuzu, but on the whole this is about enjoying natural flavors.<br/>The impressive selection of nihonshu, presented on an iPad, includes many small producers.</p><p></p>\n",

       "  <p>Make your way into this bright room donning bare wood tables and skylights. Pizzas are far above average, beginning with that unmistakable cornicione—perfect spots of char that rim the crust and bring the flavor. Toppings are just as fanciful, highlighting goat cheese, leeks and bacon; or maybe squash blossom with burrata. Come dessert, Pastry Chef Dahlia Narvaez works her magic with scrumptious treats, like Meyer lemon and kumquat crostata.</p><p></p>\n",

The result is a modern Italian take on the old-school steakhouse, with the focaccia di recco and bistecca alla Fiorentina being some of their key indulgences.</p>\n",
       "  <p>Others may choose the charcuterie, from pork terrine to pancetta. Grilled lamb shoulder chop meets its match with oven-roasted cauliflower tossed in bagna cauda. If that’s insufficient absolution, the cocoa nib-caramel tart should send you over the top.</p><p></p>\n",

If they're all sold out, the shrimp and octopus ceviche tostada, zesty with lime juice and topped with ripe avocado, is a worthy substitute.

Diners can expect to see pizza dough stretched, blenders whirring and the wood-fired oven crackling, all of which contribute to Ronan's swank allure.</p><p>Cute and quirky food descriptions make perusing the menu as entertaining as it is appetizing.

This recipe passed down through generations of Chef Maria Ramos’ family is pure and delicious comfort.</p><p>That's no knock on Ramos’ take on other specialties, including densely spiced moles, like the negro with pulled chicken in a tamal, or thin and crispy tlayudas topped with refried beans, quesillo and choice of meat.
