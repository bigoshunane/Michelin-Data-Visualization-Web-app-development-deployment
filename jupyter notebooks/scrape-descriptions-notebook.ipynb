Diners here will find that time mostly stands still inside, thanks to a simple (by design) aesthetic, dominated by wood with hints of orange, pleather booths and a buzzy bar. Throwback decor aside, most diners are here for the chef's delicate rendition of beloved Southern classics. <br/>Crisp, tender and enticingly juicy, fried chicken takes center stage. Like most other items on this menu, it is made-to-order daily and absolutely worth the wait. When coupled with succulent vegan collard greens or homemade French fries, it transforms into a heartwarming delight. Can't manage another morsel? A taste of the lemon cake slathered with butter cream will change your mind in a flash.</p>\n",

       "   <p>So what’s all the fuss about? It’s the flavorful cooking, of course. A few bites into the Griffin salad and it’s clear this kitchen knows how to handle itself. Those in the know order a half and half to explore the wide variety of pizzas. The D&amp;D’s mix of za’atar, finely diced sweet peppers and garlic chips is inventively delicious; while The Hughes piles bacon, cherry tomatoes, jalapeños and basil atop a white cheese pie slathered with a subtle and sweet tomato sauce.</p><p></p>\n",

They are as focused as the menu, which is all ramen except for the karaage served with yuzu mayo.<br/>Carefully composed bowls feature thin, chewy, house-made noodles accompanied by delicate broths with nuance and depth. The signature bowl is a smoky, triple-threat combination of tonkotsu, chicken chintan and dashi. The soy-sauce-based truffle shoyu, which also features meaty cuts of pork belly, spinach and bamboo shoots, warrants slurping. Vegan ramen is also available.</p>\n",

This Petworth perch resembles a modern diner with old-school vibes. Yellow-upholstered booths in alcoves are a haven of privacy, while the ubiquitous counter is best for solo guests.<br/>The menu, not unlike the concept, is focused. Guests can build their own bucket (or combo) and sandwich, which can be made with waffles. Starters like hot honey cauliflower; and sides like buttermilk smashed potatoes hit all the right spots. Spicy seasoning is an option for those who dare, but rolls—finished with honey butter and Maldon sea salt—are a must. Then comes the \"fancy fried chicken,\" which is brined for 24 hours and fried to crisp perfection.<br/><br/><br/> </p>\n",
