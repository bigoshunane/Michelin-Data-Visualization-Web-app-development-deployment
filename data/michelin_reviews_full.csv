0,"Chef Barry Dindyal is the talent behind this prominent and retro Petworth destination. Diners here will find that time mostly stands still inside, thanks to a simple (by design) aesthetic, dominated by wood with hints of orange, pleather booths and a buzzy bar. Throwback decor aside, most diners are here for the chef's delicate rendition of beloved Southern classics. Crisp, tender and enticingly juicy, fried chicken takes center stage. Like most other items on this menu, it is made-to-order daily and absolutely worth the wait. When coupled with succulent vegan collard greens or homemade French fries, it transforms into a heartwarming delight. Can't manage another morsel? A taste of the lemon cake slathered with butter cream will change your mind in a flash.

1,"It may be the signature cry for falling objects, but Timber Pizza Co is only on its way up. This popular neighborhood hangout is on a mounting spiral after transitioning from a farmer’s market fave to a brick-and-mortar crowd magnet that also boasts a booming takeout business.So what’s all the fuss about? It’s the flavorful cooking, of course. A few bites into the Griffin salad and it’s clear this kitchen knows how to handle itself. Those in the know order a half and half to explore the wide variety of pizzas. The D&amp;D’s mix of za’atar, finely diced sweet peppers and garlic chips is inventively delicious; while The Hughes piles bacon, cherry tomatoes, jalapeños and basil atop a white cheese pie slathered with a subtle and sweet tomato sauce.
"
2,"Once a pop-up and now a full-fledged brick-and-mortar establishment, this young'un is making waves in the city’s ramen scene. The kitchen runs the length of this sleek, narrow space in Petworth; and the young chefs running it move about with the deftness of a team many years older. They are as focused as the menu, which is all ramen except for the karaage served with yuzu mayo.Carefully composed bowls feature thin, chewy, house-made noodles accompanied by delicate broths with nuance and depth. The signature bowl is a smoky, triple-threat combination of tonkotsu, chicken chintan and dashi. The soy-sauce-based truffle shoyu, which also features meaty cuts of pork belly, spinach and bamboo shoots, warrants slurping. Vegan ramen is also available.

3,"Chef Rob Sonderman of the Federalist Pig has expanded to chicken—well, an updated version of fried chicken to be precise. This Petworth perch resembles a modern diner with old-school vibes. Yellow-upholstered booths in alcoves are a haven of privacy, while the ubiquitous counter is best for solo guests.The menu, not unlike the concept, is focused. Guests can build their own bucket (or combo) and sandwich, which can be made with waffles. Starters like hot honey cauliflower; and sides like buttermilk smashed potatoes hit all the right spots. Spicy seasoning is an option for those who dare, but rolls—finished with honey butter and Maldon sea salt—are a must. Then comes the ""fancy fried chicken,"" which is brined for 24 hours and fried to crisp perfection.

4,"This cozy Ethiopian den is an homage to Owner Selam Gossa's mother, who was a chef back in Addis Ababa. The setting, featuring a few tables framed by mismatched chairs, a long bar, and private backyard, isn't much to write home about. Having said that, the compact menu encompassing all the classics brings diners in by the droves. From vegetarian options to staples like tibs, this kitchen does it all. A platter of spongy injera is served with each dish for a bit of flourish. Tear strips of it to dip into the fragrant yebeg we't (spiced lamb stew with red chili sauce); or the shiro we't special (chickpea flour stew with tomato, garlic, and spices). With such quenching sips as the Builder (a take on the spritz with Ethiopian Honey Wine), who needs dessert?
"
5,"Walk by the kitchen at this Columbia Heights Puebla-inspired restaurant and you'll see a chef forming corn masa into tortillas and cooking them on the griddle. It's the attention to detail that makes this Mexican spot a neighborhood favorite. The menu may be concise, but every dish is made fresh and with great care. Even the green salsa that hits the table as soon as you take your seat is a standout. Start with the tacos—lighter than traditional tortillas—typically layered with crispy-edged, juicy barbacoa and red chili oil-flavored chorizo. Follow that up with the regional specialty—mole poblano with tender chicken and a slightly sweet, slightly kicky Puebla-style sauce. Good news for suburban dwellers—there is a sister location in Maryland. 
"
6,"Greeting diners at this tiny Columbia Heights retreat is a yellow neon sign. The interior design, however, exudes all the understated feels, by way of white floors, blue banquettes, an intricately decorated counter and sleek metal stools. Nooks framed by geometric screens ensure the utmost privacy.The menu reveals a modern take on Hong Kong plates. These high-heat wok dishes show a blend of fresh ingredients and balanced flavors. Lotus root salad with anchovy dust and a charred tomato vinaigrette; or cured hamachi spiced with cumin, brushed with seaweed oil and set atop watermelon make for a great starting point. Not far behind, Wagyu rosettes gently poached in a ""mala"" broth are crowned by duck egg yolk and soy foam for a flourishing finish. 
"
7,"If you've ever considered ordering dessert first, do it here. Flaky, crispy roti canai served with a delicate pandan coconut cream offers a faithful Asian twist on the classic French Toast. It's the kind of cross-cultural deliciousness you can expect from this Malaysian kitchen team, which takes its culinary cues from India and China.To that end, both noodles and rice form the heart of this menu. Char kway teow features seared flat rice strands tossed with shrimp, Chinese sausage and bean sprouts. Hearty pork vindaloo boasts layer upon layer of just the right spice, heat and acid. Fried chicken arrives doused in a yellow curry flecked with curry leaves. Yes, you should share everything, but no, you cannot nap on those turquoise couches after.
"
8,"Chef/co-owner Seng Luangrath continues to wow crowds with Thip Khao, in ever-transforming Columbia Heights. The menu tempts with its sheer variety of tempting options ranging from snacks and salads to soups, curries and a panoply of entrées. Naem khao, a crispy coconut rice salad, bursts with fresh and fragrant flavor, while muu som, cured and slow-cooked pork belly, is wonderfully fatty. Crispy pig ears dusted with a deliciously tart tamarind salt and dipped in fermented chili-fish sauce are both original and outstanding; but the knap paa, or Chilean sea bass, is a true standout. Brushed with curry paste and coconut cream, then grilled in a banana leaf, this dish will have you wondering if it's dinner or a present?
"
9,"The mood in this wee dining room is appealingly boisterous, and the food nothing less than well regarded. Yet this team has never let good press go to their heads. Instead, they continue to up their game by creating an array of adobos and other dynamo dishes, inspired by the Philippines with subtle Chinese and Spanish influences.Don’t look for homestyle, since they do their best work on genre-bending dishes. Dig into the vibrant purple ensaladang ifugao, or kinilaw na pugita with octopus and salt-cured olives. Some may even throw caution to the wind and go for the weekly dinner menu, unveiling the likes of adobong dilaw. This moist and tender claypot chicken special, tossed with turmeric-infused coconut sauce, is best when paired with a mound of white rice.
"
10,"Set inside the buzzing Union Market, Rappahannock Oyster Bar is so much more than a popular bivalve joint. The feel-good revival story behind it will make you feel more philanthropist than hungry diner, and the ambience is everything you’d expect and then some: counter space, communal seating, a sprinkling of outdoor tables and an open-air vibe.While the spotlight here is on the raw bar (order the sampler, a veritable love letter to the Virginia waters), cooked dishes give those half-shells a run for their money. Clam chowder is thick, creamy and full of briny meat; and though the steamed shrimp dish sounds simple, these spicy shell-on specimens, served with a hunk of bread, sautéed onions and peppers, are a messy but delicious affair.
"
11,"You will indeed fare well at Bidwell, tucked inside Union Market with its array of stalls peddling everything from arepas to empanadas. It checks off all of the boxes for a modern hot spot with its industrial-chic design, hipster-packed bar and buzz-worthy cooking. Bidwell takes the farm-to-table trend and tops it—quite literally—since the rooftop garden supplies much of the produce.Salads are a great way to sample the goods of this kitchen. Start with the Cobb, combining crisp romaine, cherry tomatoes, blue cheese and slices of perfect skirt steak. The popular Irish-American onion soup pairs well with a selection of sausages, while grilled chicken sandwich is a lunchtime thrill. Butterscotch pudding with chocolate shavings is an absolute sweet treat.
"
12,"This concept from Chef Juan Manuel Barrientos can be found adjacent to Union Market's La Cosecha. Presentation is the cornerstone here, with an admirable level of showmanship and dishes embody a love letter to the chef's native Colombia.À la carte is the rule in the front room, but make your way down to an intimate space for serious culinary sorcery. This is deeply personal cooking that utilizes the bounty of fish, grains, and tropical produce. Behold a carrot soup with guava jelly (inspired by the chef's grandmother) or hamachi atop a plantain chip (a nod to his Japanese chef mentor). Your meal's culmination may be as chimerical as its commencement, with an ice-cold plate bearing a swipe of lulu ice cream sprinkled with apple-basil powder.
"
13,"You’ll want to wake up with the rooster to score a reservation at this rustic Italian gem as it’s incredibly popular, and always packed. Walk-ins can snag a seat at the three-sided bar that anchors the room, decked out in full country charm with exposed brick walls, reclaimed timber and beamed ceilings. What’s so special, you ask? The food, of course, which is terrific. Pastas are spot on and include cacio e pepe “arancini,” crowd-favorite mezzi rigatoni or even the mafalde verde—a sweet-and-savory combo of braised duck ragù, Calabrian chili and pecorino romano. Entrées like grilled short rib or scallops with pickled chili aïoli are also exquisite.The short wine list features unusual selections (Slovenia, anyone?) and very affordable prices.

28,"Rasika vets, Dante Datta and Chef Suresh Sundas, are behind this much-anticipated Indian operation. The corner space, flaunting a windowed façade and white-ringed Sanskrit logo, is an instant attention grabber. Weather permitting, a large sidewalk increases the dining capacity.Inside, at the bar-counter set abuzz with vibrant tunes, the kitchen team takes classic Indian cuisine in a novel direction. Is that blue cheese on your tandoor-grilled chicken kebabs? Yes, indeed. Matched with sour cherry reduction and cashews, it's as enticing a preparation as the boldly spiced minced bison momos. Nariyal lamb shank is rich and robust with saffron, chili and coconut. Sop up the heady sauce with light basmati rice and call it a night.
"
29,"Stone-cold serious barbecue makes its way to the DC area via this rustic spot from owner, Steve Salis. A handful of communal picnic tables arranged under a string of bistro lights mark the entrance to the Federalist Pig. Once inside, you’ll see a long line of customers snaking through the space, waiting to order at the counter, where the servers pile your grub onto butcher paper-lined trays. Over in the kitchen, the pitmaster's wood-smoked pork, brisket and turkey might just be some of the best ‘cue you’ll find in town. So do yourself a favor and order the “works” to try a bit of everything only to find that almost nothing disappoints. Equally craveable are their inventive and filling sandwiches, with clever names like The Faux Q or The Big Bad Wolf. 
"
30,"“Sababa,” which means “cool” in Hebrew slang, is exactly as advertised. Sharing a wall and connected by a gorgeous zinc bar to Bindaas next door, this ode to the Middle East is awash in Mediterranean tiles. But despite the hip digs, it’s all about food here. The fine-tuned menu features Israeli salads, dips and kebabs, but small plates are its heart and soul. Start with salatim, a five-salad starter. Then choose from dishes such as charred eggplant with herbed labneh, fried cauliflower with tahini and raisins or pomegranate-glazed chicken liver. The list goes on, but one thing to never skip is the hummus. It’s so much more than the usual that it’s even listed as a daily special. Keeping in line with the spirit is their Israeli- and Greek-focused wine list.
"
31,"Climb the creaky wooden stairs and take your seat among a homey hodgepodge of chairs and tables. If it feels like someone’s house, that’s the point (you’ll pour your own water, too). There’s no menu to bother with, so settle in with your pals and prepare yourself for a parade of Thai dishes that satisfies hungry patrons without breaking the bank.Feast on up to ten different dishes, ranging from dumplings, green papaya salad and pork skewers, before delving into the kitchen’s signature pumpkin curry. The tender pumpkin cubes bobbing in a red curry balances its sweetness without ever tasting like dessert. Tom yum soup is another crowd-pleaser with shrimp as well as a zippy lime and fish sauce. Mango coconut sticky rice closes out the night on a tropical note.
"
32,"This airy, quaint, and relaxed all-day spot likes to keep things low-maintenance. The price point too is agreeably lower than its fussier competitors, and the Latin American food is decidedly scrumptious. No wonder, it's a legitimate local favorite.Breakfast is a must, especially if the messy, eggy arepa is on offer. Served wrapped in a white pouch, it resembles a present crafted from seared masa and filled with a fried egg, tomato, cotjia, and avocado. At dinner, hungry fans head to the intimate second-level space—complete with original details—to try their hand at tender pork empanadas laced with aji and the heavenly scent of garlic. The masa “gnocchi” is a rare treat, tossed with braised beef, maitake mushrooms, and loads of herbs.
"
33,"Maketto is the love child of the hip gods of fashion and food. Walk in off ever-changing H Street and you’ll instantly be met with glittering cases brimming with eyewear and accessories. Stave off the urge to shop (for now) and focus on the menu instead—a mod mashup of Cambodian and Taiwanese items. Coupled with inventive cocktails, it is proof positive that this is far from your average department store diner.Everything on this menu is meant to share, though you might not want to with creative efforts like crispy Gruyère dumplings with Chinese beef chili. Classic soup dumplings are a favorite and fried chicken finished in a five-spice caramel is a high point. Spicy lamb noodles with fermented chili paste showcase the kitchen’s skill with a wok.
"
34,"Many restaurants boast of inspired flavors and technique, but few flaunt such cooking prowess as Maydān—a veritable showstopper whose roaring hearth verges on wildfire. The precision required of the team may be consuming and cooking technique elemental, but the results are delicious bliss. À la carte is available, but the prix-fixe is a popular feast, with bread and spreads; veggies and meats; and a dessert to round it out. Flatbreads with muhamarra, hummus and smoked mutabal is a meal unto itself; while tahini-coconut rice pudding with candied cardamom makes a compelling finish.Guests seated in this rustic space—with patterned wood and lofty ceilings—are made even more comfortable with an array of singular Middle Eastern-inspired sips and labels.
"
35,"You’ll go up the stairs, not down to Toki Underground, which shares the same front door as The Pug Bar. Once inside, notice raw wood beams, walls plastered with stickers and scribble, as well as dangling Christmas lights that exude a sense of childlike angst. That angst may grow into full-blown annoyance, as the waits are staggeringly long (there are just 30 counter seats and no tables), but come for lunch to steer clear of all lines.Fried chicken steamed buns; lightly battered and delicately fried enoki mushrooms; or pork dumplings are a good way to start things off. The Toki classic with chashu pork and a soft egg is a signature dish, and the broth is slurp-worthy. Its stick-to-your-bones porky intensity is especially memorable.
"
36,"There are more than seven reasons to visit this gorgeous bi-level restaurant and good looks are certainly one. The airy and sophisticated décor features greenery crawling up the brick walls and elegant mid-century modern touches.The food too generates plenty of buzz, thanks to an ambitious menu that pulls from Venezuela, Peru, and the Caribbean.Watch as the chefs get down to business in the bright open kitchen. Generously portioned, their creations certainly pack a punch with a litany of ingredients. Patacón piña colada unveils discs of fried green plantains, topped with pickled pineapple, shaved coconut, and a myriad of sauces—think cilantro mojo and caper mayo. It arrives garnished with purple micro greens and is a riot of color and flavors to match.
"
37,"A simple black and glass facade belies the delicious small plates available at this place. Pass a set of double doors to be greeted by a U-shaped bar, arched ceilings, and romantic dining room, Fitted out with muted green-tiled floors and snug tables, the restrooms are perhaps the most unique feature here—displaying clever illustrations of wine descriptions. Unsurprisingly, natural wines are a serious focus and pair wonderfully with the shareable plates.Begin with grilled oysters and garlic butter or meatballs atop polenta. Then indulge in the star of the show—house-made pasta, like tagliolini tossed with Maine uni, tomato sauce, and preserved lemon breadcrumbs. A round of semifreddo with olive oil, grilled citrus, and coarse salt nicely finishes the show.
"
38,"Pioneers of vegan cuisine, the power couple behind this operation initially made it big at Philly’s Vedge. Set at the base of an urbane building, the industrial-chic space is abuzz with locals, who are all here for their haute approach to vegan cuisine. Having said that, they turn out so much more than just that. Flavorful and satisfying are words that come to mind when sampling razor-thin trumpet mushrooms, which are a clever stand-in for pasta, bathed with a silky broth. Rich and spicy dan dan noodles are then tossed with a tahini-based sauce for a glossy and intensely savory bite.This kitchen team keeps you on your toes right through dessert—when hearty chickpea-flour donuts are paired with rhubarb- and sour cherry-gazpacho for a delectable last act.
"
39,"The flavors and heat of Southeast Asian are on full display at this Northeast DC eatery. Though the menu spans much of the country, Laos’ menu—sporting a section devoted entirely to vegans—still manages to be original, offering ingredients that are rarely found in similar restaurants. It also promises—and delivers on—dishes marked “phet"" (or spicy).Generous slices of sausage with savory herbs are served with crunchy green papaya, peanuts and fiery green chili; while the chef’s signature papaya salad arrives with bright green beans, Laos pork loaf and a mellow fermented fish sauce. Don’t miss the unique orm, a tender chicken-and-dill curry, imbued with Asian eggplant, cabbage, scallions and more green beans.
"
40,"It’s yellow, not the deep blue of its name, that defines this sunny Indian restaurant. Located in a cheerful house with a patio full of colorful picnic tables, Indigo is far from fancy (it’s largely self-service and food is served in disposable containers). But, how can you not adore a place where love notes from customers cover the walls? Indian expats and residents line up for classic comfort cooking from the sub-continent such as the spicy chicken masala and tender, melt-in-your-mouth goat curry. Even side dishes are elevated here—for instance, daal is packed with smoky flavor and doused in a cardamom-scented relish, while paneer paratha (flatbread stuffed with cheese, onion, chopped red chilies and cilantro) is especially fluffy.
"
41,"This family-owned and operated Adams Morgan spot easily gives its brethren a run for their money—the food is that good. Its interior is welcoming, flooded with natural light and generously spaced tables; comfortable booths along one wall, beautiful artwork, as well as a long bar pouring wines and spirits welcomes one and all.This kitchen's exquisite cuisine reflects the many fascinating nuances of Ethiopia itself. While many cultures break bread together, few do it as well as this one, where injera is torn apart to scoop up stews, like awaze tibs. Its tender lamb cubes in a smoky, brick-red berbere are simmered to tender perfection, then crowned with greens, spicy lentils and potatoes for a dish that rarely receives the credit—or fanfare—it is due.
"
42,"It's set on busy 14th Street, but beautiful Bresca far from blends in with the crowd. Instead, it mixes the warmth of a neighborhood treasure with the talent of a special occasion spot. Inside, splashes of gold, a living wall crafted from moss and design elements teetering between whimsical and downright surreal, create a contemporary vibe. The cooking is casual yet ambitious, thanks to Chef Ryan Ratino’s cutting-edge credentials. His menu is divided into categories, like snacks, medium plates, and large, shareable plates. Find a clear sense of artistry in the likes of a foie gras ""negroni"" topped with Campari gelée or the agreeably priced and perfect pappardelle with lamb ragù.Cocktails, like The Daulphine St. Punch, may be relished in lieu of dessert.
"
43,"The neighborhood teems with energy, and this Italian dining room dances to that same beat. Though a second location lives on in Georgetown, this original is unmatched in both charm and quality. The lower level of this two-storied space feels much like an osteria, thanks to a welcoming Carrara marble bar and communal tables; while the upstairs flaunts a more rustic vibe.On the menu, grilled octopus with cannellini bean salad and fried artichokes with bagna cauda make for a fantastic start. But the heart of this kitchen is the homemade pasta. Paccheri tossed with octopus and prawns; ravioli stuffed with braised short ribs; or eggy tagliatelle tangled with Italian sausage and cherry tomatoes offer warmth and comfort. Finish with the Nutella bomboloni.
"
44,"Set in a stylish space with playful décor (one wall boasts a picture of President Obama eating a double), this is a menu devoted to Trinidadian street food. The chef's experience at some of the top kitchens in DC simply ensures that quality and execution is through the roof. Everything prepared by the kitchen is delicious: think rich stews, perfect doubles and channa, redolent of spices and heat. The pepperpot arrives smoldering with aromatic cinnamon; while perfectly braised brisket in spicy brown sauce features tender root vegetables, paired with rice and scooped into a fresh coconut shell. 
"
45,"Tucked into a buzzing corner, this sunny little retreat packs a serious flavor punch. Guests may grab a seat at the counter facing the open kitchen, or in one of two dining areas decked out with sleek tables and blonde wood chairs. Weather permitting, there’s outdoor seating as well.Chef Wade Hoo Fatt is the man behind this menu, focused on the bright and healthy flavors of Vietnam's markets. Imagine the likes of spring rolls with pork and shrimp, or chilled rice noodles with pickled vegetables and a sweet-and-sour broth. Vegetarians will appreciate the shredded mango tossed with carrots, endive and a tamarind dressing; while fruit juices and smoothies are sure to sate many a sweet tooth.
"
46,"The space is snug, romantic and trendy; its cooking is notably creative; and beverages are reviving. Tastefully decked out with artwork, smoky mirrors and a full bar, gracious servers along with plush seats will lull you into a soothing and delicious meal.Chef Cristian Granada's dynamic menu certainly leans Peruvian, it also embraces the nation's wide terrain—from the coast all the way to influences from Europe and Asia. Behold the tiradito, featuring sashimi-grade ahi tuna with a passion fruit-and-orange sauce. Classics, like ají de gallina, is served with rice; while the much raved-about arroz chaufa is a global delight. Desserts, like the seasonal flan, warrant bright, beaming smiles.
"
47,"It is highly rare for a tasting menu to leave one feeling—well—energized, but so goes the imaginative cooking at this vegetable-focused gem. Who knew that turnip juice makes for good bread or that oysters can turn into a creamy and yet entirely creamless sauce? Chef Rob Rubba did, and his creations are delicious insights into what is possible with vegetables.Thin strands of fried celery root weaved around smoked tofu and garnished with onion powder is delicate and replete with umami. Roasted lion’s mane mushroom with spring onion mole and black-eyed peas is a combination you didn’t know you were craving. Local farms are the very essence of this sustainable restaurant; even carnivores cannot deny its food is original, confident and tastes as good as it looks.
"
48,"Chef Myo Htun, who hails from Myanmar, has spent time refining his culinary skills. The result? This vibrant Shaw operation, known for its conversation-worthy cocktails and excellent cuisine. Granted, while ramen may be all the rage in town, only a few rise to the level of this delicious hot spot. Not only are this chef's versions myriad, his approach is personal and especially slurpable. Diners may opt for the hot or cold ramen. The former (Chaplin A.S.S.) arrives with gloriously tender slabs of chicken and a sweltering broth; while the latter, with springy noodles, zesty ginger and cool cucumber, is equally gratifying. Bites, like gyoza, shumai and chap ban ji, are as intrinsic to this kitchen as the chocolate lava cake with Cognac and ice cream. 
"
49,"Take a break from the Beltway and head to Millie’s. It’s an offshoot of the Nantucket original, with a loyal whale-patterned shorts-wearing crowd. Sound preppy? It is. The space nails that breezy, nautical vibe with navy blue booths, a ceiling strung with boats and not-too-twee ship lanterns. It’s almost impossible not to be cheerful here—even the open kitchen buzzes with activity, simply enhancing the convivial aura.Equally upbeat is the menu that shines a spotlight on New England. Seared tuna tacos with wasabi cream and ceviche are light and refreshing; while the heady fragrance of the blue crab fried rice will induce envy from nearby tables. Maryland crab cake piled atop a fluffy brioche and slathered with herb aïoli tastes of summer by the sea.
"
50,"This bright and trendy sibling-owned spot is made with love—and it clearly shows. Enter to find a smattering of yellow metal chairs, walls vibrant with art and a kitchen teeming with a focused brigade—serious women chefs preparing complex Ethiopian fare, with nostalgia at the forefront.The family platter, with both vegetarian and meat dishes, is an excellent way to sample the variety. That beloved sour and spongy injera is ideal for sopping up the likes of gomen (collard greens with fresh garlic and onions) or kik alicha (a stew of yellow split peas with turmeric and ginger). Tikil gomen with cabbage and potatoes is an herbivore's dream; while quanta firfir, deliciously tender beef imbued with berbere and purified butter, has carnivores coming in droves.
"
51,"Truth be told, Convivial excels in all areas. It scores major points for its location, anchoring the base of City Market at O in the hip Shaw neighborhood; ranks high on style with its clean, rustic-modern aesthetic; and boasts warm service—Chef and co-owner Cedric Maupillier is often seen chatting with customers. Of course, the real reason diners keep coming back to this energetic hot spot is most certainly for the food: bold and playful takes on the tried-and-true that are made for sharing.Popular with young professionals, families and academics from nearby Howard University, this whimsical new-meets-old menu marries French and American cuisine. Think cured herring over smashed potato salad or pear mousse with caramelized, sliced almonds.
"
52,"This bright and bold kid on the block boasts a concise menu with strong American inflections. Enter to discover two colorful dining rooms on either side of the space, as well as a buzzing bar in the back. Spread across a few floors (that culminate in a rooftop bar as your reward for the climb), details like textured metal, marble tables, and artfully lit bottles enhance the convivial vibe.The menu is divvied into mostly raw, vegetables, pasta, meats, and larger dishes. Regardless of your pick, these plates are well-executed and show a creative spirit. Start with such sea treats as a risotto of Carolina Gold rice, clam juice and creamy uni, then segue into land by way of the beef Wellington, which sports a golden pastry, braised leeks, and veal jus.
"
53,"Go ahead and order breakfast all day long, since Keren keeps the morning meal front and center. However, before you show up expecting bacon and eggs, take a second look, as this is a showpiece of Eritrean cuisine. The East African nation was once occupied by Italy, and this history continues to be an influential force on its cuisine—with many pasta-centric dishes popping up on the menu. A loyal crowd alternates between watching soccer, debating Eritrean politics and filling up on the sizable portions.Ful, a staple breakfast dish of favas, jalapeño, tomato and onion, is a good place to start (there are six variations). Then go for the “five Eritrean” items for a well-rounded, veg-focused combo that's so good you'll be unable to pick a favorite.
"
54,"Set on the second floor of a townhouse just outside Little Ethiopia, this tidy dining room may have the bright walls and exposed brick so often seen in mom-and-pop spots, but rest assured that it delivers more than just a spicy stew with a home-kitchen feel.It’s the under-the-radar and off-the-menu dishes that lure locals and expats with bated breath. Diners can expect authentic items native to the culturally rich region of the namesake mountains. Rip off a piece of the cool and lacy injera before digging in to the lamb wat, a tender stew fueled by the fiery notes of berbere. Simmered vegetables add a welcome dose of earthy flavor on the side; while the go-to vegetarian combo platter can deservedly be described as deluxe.
"
55,"With its slightly nautical ambience and casual pub vibe, this spot makes an ideal clubhouse for play-hard types. And while places that look this good usually don’t have the menu to match, Pearl Dive’s kitchen gives the dining room a run for its money.The lineup is true-blue American food with a Southern slant, spotlighting starters like crunchy crawfish fritters, regional gumbos and entrées like Tchoupitoulas—oyster confit with blue crab, Tasso ham as well as roasted corn. And then there are the incredible oysters, which are part of the Oyster Recovery Project (meaning you can feel good while you slurp them up with abandon). On your way out, make like the smug, in-the-know patrons and order the Brazos River-bottom pecan pie to go.
"
56,"Chef Massimo Fabbri, who long ruled the kitchen at DC’s beloved Tosca, has traded in those white tablecloths for this neighborhood charmer, named after his son (Lorenzo is the “patron saint of cooks”). Photos of the chef's Tuscan hometown adorn the exposed brick walls and painted tiles line the floor, hinting at the delicious regional specialties that await.A dinner in this chef's hands might begin with tender squash blossoms stuffed with truffled goat cheese and fried to perfection. Pasta is a must: try crown-shaped tortelli with robiola and black truffle, pooled in a porcini mushroom sauce; or splurge on the parmesan risotto, dusted with freshly shaved white truffles. Maple panna cotta with caramelized apples and oat streusel is a refreshing finale. 
"
57,"Tokyo-born Minoru Ogawa is running something of a mini-empire with Sushi Capitol, Mirai and the sushi counter at the Mandarin Oriental. But, Sushi Ogawa is his namesake and the most intimate (there are just seven seats at the counter). The interior design is clean and contemporary, with warm accents of honey wood.Omakase is always the preferred manner of business here, however, be ready as it comes out at lightning speed and the litany of nigiri delivered your way may just make you vertiginous. Sashimi, often blowtorched, may include Spanish mackerel, tuna, clam or sea trout with scallions; while the nigiri follows a rhythm and flow from simple to complex. The itamae listen closely and might even throw in a few extra pieces of your favorite fish.
"
58,"Tiger Fork feels secreted away. Indeed, its location off the main road makes finding it a challenge, but arrive and discover a sultry Hong Kong-style den. Inside, find brick walls emblazoned with dragons and mountains, Chinese basket-style lanterns, and warehouse floors that show off a sexy, hip look. Then get to sipping on one of their many glorious potions, such as the Bird Market, a chartreuse blended with elderflower, bai zhu and bergamot.Some plates may miss the mark but dishes like the slightly sweet cheung fun and spicy chili wontons are spot on. Glossy, thick pork ribs are brushed with a soy and ginger sauce for umami glory. Crack open that fortune cookie but don’t expect Confucius since you’re more likely to get words of wisdom from Gucci Mane.
"
59,"The once-mundane Blagden Alley now teems with exciting culinary gems, including The Dabney. Entering this spot is like finding the end of a rainbow—imagine a farmhouse-chic space with an open kitchen, wood-fired oven and well-dressed crowd.Thanks to Chef Jeremiah Langhorne's direction, the cuisine is suitable for anyone looking to delve into regional, Mid-Atlantic food through a menu that marries traditional and unexpected flavors. To wit—scallop crudo finished with a shard of sheep's milk cheese. Though a set menu, come with a group to sample more of the inventive dishes, including the very homey chicken and dumplings. Save room for such classic desserts as an apple crumble with house-made ice cream bearing just a hint of bourbon.

"
60,"Brick walls, funky artwork and wood floors offset by greenery await at Anju. The result is a homey-meets-hip space that feels comfy even when jam-packed. The name refers to Korean dishes best enjoyed with alcohol, highlighting a range of sweet, salty and spicy tastes. Similarly, the menu showcases a series of typical offerings—from fried foods to rich stews along with beer, soju and makgeolli to boot.Start with banchan like Brussels sprouts and apple kimchi, before devouring the perfect pork mandu. Diners longing for a taste of home will find comfort in the items from Chef/owner Danny Lee's mother, Yesoon Lee, like dak jjim (sweet chili-braised chicken with potatoes and onions) or dolsot bibimbap, blending crisped rice with tofu and grilled veggies.
"
61,"This large, square dining room is ultra-grand and yet ultra-charming, with a melange of earthy, vivid hues, an inviting bar, and display kitchen fitted out with a tandoor oven. Find a seat at one of the high-backed banquettes or wood tables to start sampling from the classic Persian menu. Get those taste buds going with a yogurt dip accompanied by naan, radishes, feta, and herbs. Then dive full steam into an intensely savory gormeh sabzi—a stew of scallion, beef, and red kidney beans—served with saffron Basmati rice.Desserts enhance the experience, with the staple baklava or a more creative Ice cream sandwich with rosewater and pistachios. Thirsty travelers will appreciate the Glimpse of Paradise cocktail, starring vodka, grapefruit, and cardamom syrup.
"
62,"This place is fit for royalty. The interior is drop-dead gorgeous with a can’t-stop-staring décor. From its honeycomb patterns on the walls and that large mural of the Hagia Sophia, to its whitewashed walls with glimmering deep-blue pendants, this restaurant brings a little bit of Istanbul to the Mt. Vernon Triangle. Sip a cool apple-rose tea while perusing the menu of Turkish cuisine infused with a modern bent. Kirmizi mercimek corbasi is a refreshing red lentil soup that starts things off right. Then dive in to thinly sliced and delicious lamb and beef kebabs. But it’s the moussaka, with its supple eggplant, potato slices and cinnamon-scented lamb, that must not be skipped. Freshly baked baklava or Noah’s pudding end the meal on a syrupy note.
"
63,"A dining room that delivers a festive mood along with delightful food. Yes, it's an all-around win for this large Richard Sandoval operation, spread over two floors. The setting is chic, rustic and accoutred with private rooms, brick archways and leather seats; while the bar, which offers a view of the open kitchen, is best for alcohol-fueled fun.Guacamole de bonito, uplifted by smoky charred tostadas, is a thrilling way to begin proceedings. What follows may include everything from corn empanadas with manchego, ají amarillo and chimichurri, to shrimp enchiladas made extra smoky with guajillo salsa and tangy with crema fresca. Pumpkin bread with orange blossom milk, spiced pepitas and cinnamon ice cream is a light, lovely and seasonal treat.
"
64,"Magnificent Métier may be accessed via an elevator, which deposits guests into a moody lounge. Beyond, lies the spare and sleek dining space, which may be best described as one part living room and two parts art gallery. This is one of those few places where jackets are required, so gentlemen don’t forget to don them.Chef Eric Ziebold plies his ""metier"" in an ambitious tasting that pulls global flavors in inspired ways. A riff on cassoulet, for instance, unveils flageolet bean purée with a pork jowl croquette and Santa Barbara uni. The crowning flourish is a sorbet made from aji dulce peppers grown at the restaurant's garden in VA. A satin-smooth, double fermented chocolate ganache with toasted fennel-crème anglaise is as stunning as it is ingenious.
"
65,"Supra is a gem for Georgian cuisine, so make those resys. The dining room’s paneling and  wood tables lean elegant, while the hanging sheep hats flaunt regional flair. This chef churns out authentic dishes with a dose of delicious. Start with spreads and cheeses, before devouring soup dumplings or mussels. No diner worth their salt would dare skip the imeruli or ajaruli khachapuri—crusty bread with a pit of molten cheese and runny egg. White pelamushi flaunts a riff on the staple dessert (think: pomegranate caramel and walnut crumble), no feast is complete without wine with selections from one of the world's oldest viticultural regions.Sister restaurant Tabla offers a similar, if slightly more condensed ​​​​​Georgian focused menu, in a casual setting.
"
66,"The original of four locations, Hank’s Oyster Bar promises a good time and a full stomach. Snag a seat on the spacious front patio or opt for a table indoors where bottles of malt vinegar and Old Bay seasoning are a sign of things to come.Meals begin with a bowl of humble Goldfish cheese crackers, then prepare yourself for a sea, ahem, of dishes. Feast on platters of raw bar beauties (including Hank's signature Salty Wolfe oyster) to oysters any way you want them (Hog Island style involves dunking in a tangy lemon-garlic-Tabasco-butter sauce, a sprinkling of breadcrumbs and shredded cheese and broiling until caramelized). Lobster rolls, creamy chowder and crab cake sandwiches with Old Bay-seasoned fries conjure up days at the beach from years gone by. 
"
67,"Kinship is a prominent fixture thanks to Chef Eric Ziebold and wife/partner Célia Laurent’s inspired cuisine. They have earned a devoted following who gladly dress to dine here. In addition to Métier downstairs, the space comprises a fireplace-warmed lounge, lively bar and minimalist-chic dining room.The à la carte isn't just a litany of offerings; it's a peek inside Chef Ziebold's heart and mind. Pick and choose from the different categories to create a bespoke tasting menu that could include a thrilling tempura-fried soft-shell crab in a spiced tomato broth, or a roast chicken worth every moment of its 75-minute preparation. Don't miss dessert, like the passion fruit tart with ginger-lime sorbet or chocolate ganache tart with Madras curry ice cream.
"
68,"If the name wasn’t already a giveaway, the large comal by the window and row of golden corn husks hanging along the wall should tell you what matters most to this restaurant—corn. Heirloom varieties sourced from Mexico are nixtamalized, ground into masa, pressed into tortillas, and griddled at all hours. They frequently accompany dishes as either a crisp chip for scooping or a soft sponge for dipping. Combinations like the corn tamal with charred tomatillo and goat cheese or seared duck breast with green apple purée signal more contemporary ideas; while traditional mole like the rich manchamanteles is a must.After dinner, head to the underground cocktail lounge, where mezcal is front and center. Service, all the while, is earnest from start to finish.
"
69,"Many diners walking into East End's shiny Capitol Crossing development already know what they’re ordering. Chef David Deshaies' 40-layer lasagna has captivated the city’s attention and rightfully so. Tender short rib, truffled mornay and razor-thin sheets of pasta make for a delicious trinity that tastes as good as it looks.With soaring ceilings and windows to match, this Italian kitchen has plenty more to offer. A wood-burning grill and pizza oven allude to its other strengths. At no point does any dish want for flavor, down to the charred cabbage buried under a riot of trout roe, tarragon and currants. Some will be perfectly content sidling up to the expansive bar for a glass of vino and round of snacks, like saffron arancini or duck ravioli.
"
70,"Astoria DC is a sultry and sexy Dupont Circle spot. It stands apart from its neighboring facades by way of gleaming glass panes etched with the name printed in gold leaf. If you can't stand the heat, then shy away from this scorcher, since they dole out some seriously fiery food.Dan dan noodles are creamy, savory and rather like those chili wontons in a tongue-numbing sauce that bursts with porky goodness. Tuck into the tender water-boiled beef dish, a brisket with just the right flavor balance, before savoring the well-prepared mapo tofu that delivers less of a kick but all the flavor. While the crunch of the walnut shrimp is offset by a glossy sauce, the sober soup is a deliciously clean bowl of thick broth loaded with cellophane-thin pork wontons.
"
71,"Aficionados give this respite a pass for its odd location—adjacent to a pharmacy and accessed by stairs—but the interior opens up into a warm dining room. Sushi Taro may offer à la carte and tastings, but the experience at the six-seat counter with a single service nightly is highly recommended. Scoring a seat at the counter is especially challenging;  but once secured you're granted entry to a room attended with care and grace.There are a series of small plates, perhaps squid ink-tinted soft-shell crab tempura or salad of hairy crab. Then, diners are invited to make selections from trays of fish, which are then knifed into sashimi. An equally striking nigiri course allows for delving deeper into the assemblage. 
"
72,"This Kalorama diva offers a unique setting, having taken up residence in a modest brick building. Walk through a set of doors to arrive at a cool marble bar, where sipping a cocktail is almost de rigueur. Up a few stairs and you're in the artwork-clad dining room, where elegance reigns over trend. A green skylight and ""garden"" oasis will have you feeling one with Mother Nature.Chef Frank Ruta's contemporary American menu shows a seasonal focus. Flaunting regional inspiration, the summer bean and peach salad makes a great start; while gnocchi with black trumpet mushrooms is an eternal favorite. The pastry program is strong, so dessert is a must. In fact, the gianduja ganache with cinnamon ice cream and blood orange gelée had us planning a return trip.
"
73,"This seductive dining room took a cool few million to create, but it is utterly chic and wholly Parisian. Pretty patio-facing marble tables, salmon-hued chairs, tufted banquettes, and greenery create the feeling of dining in a terrarium. Over in the kitchen, the chefs don't cling to any one trend. Imagine a melange of plates like prawn cocktail, lobster bisque, handmade pastas, as well as mains like Dover sole meunière or veal Milanese and you'll start to get their drift. Mediterranean flavors also find their way into dishes like octopus fricassee with black olives and lamb tagine with couscous. Close with a simple yet irresistible lemon tart.Set inside the Dupont Circle Hotel, this smart spot radiates much joy thanks to its genial vibe and solid food.
"
74,"Swanky French wine bar meets delectable Asian bites at Bar Chinois. The space is eternally lively and the menu, with dim sum aplenty, is enticing.While this may be a bar first (thrilling cocktails include a martini with pickled pearl onions, pickled shiitake mushrooms, plus kombu and bonito flakes), the kitchen takes its cooking seriously, offering a lineup of mouthwatering plates. Imagine half moon-shaped ginger chicken dumplings with a honey dip; shrimp toast batter-fried with sesame seeds; or Beijing pork dumplings with Berkshire pork and Chinese chives. The ""Lion's Head meatball,"" starring oven-braised pork au jus, water chestnuts, and Shaoxing rice wine, is as regal as its title, and bears an almost apocryphal lightness.
"
75,"This farm-to-table restaurant in the stunning Conrad Hotel is an homage to the Chesapeake. Take the toasted Maryland blue crab and shrimp brioche roll, for instance, which oozes with organic butter and fish sauce-flavored mayonnaise. Old Bay fries make an excellent accompaniment to this item, not unlike the fennel pollen and flurry of micro herbs that enhance a mound of tuna tartare with heat from Calabrian chilies. While seafood figures heavily on the menu, it’s not the sole offering. Desserts, like the peanut butter-cheesecake, make for a rich and memorable sendoff.Views from the space frame the energetic downtown scene. Yet, it's hard not to be drawn to the theatrics of the open kitchen, where cooks work by the glow of library-style lamps.
"
76,"This lively operation arrives courtesy of Chef Katsuya Fukushima and the Daikaya Restaurant Group. Housed right by their sister spot, the minimalist space is clad with sleek dark wooden slats on the outside. Make your way inside, to the first level, which draws in a diverse crowd thanks to sleek white walls, light wood accents, Japanese figurines, and straw-covered wine bottles. An open kitchen hums at the back.The Wafu cooking too flaunts a certain uniqueness while remaining balanced and precise. Dishes may be best described as Japanese-influenced Italian. This mix is unfussy and seamless in the likes of spaghetti with Kurobuta sausage and a refined Tabasco-ketchup sauce. Chocolate budino with whipped cream makes a simple finish to a striking meal.
"
77,"It would be a mistake to write off Chef Matt Baker’s venture as just another hotel restaurant. This much is clear after an amuse of artichoke velouté. Indeed, freshly baked brioche, crispy duck confit and elaborately prepared vegetables score impressive marks at this French-American brasserie, named after the chef’s late mother and inspired by his upbringing in Houston and New Orleans.The Eaton Hotel, which also houses Baker’s casual café and bakery, is fortunate to play host to such an accomplished team—one that sources well and seasons with panache, all the while running an impressive bar that is as large as the dining room. Seafood towers and caviar service will no doubt tempt the big spenders on a menu that has something for everybody.
"
78,"The old adage ""Never judge a book by its cover"" couldn't be more apt for this operation, which seems a most unlikely candidate for ""serious food."" It's vast and spread over three levels, but when you're seated in that perfect nook full of pretty people and tantalizing cocktails you'll start to get the drift.There is no denying Chef Kristen Essig's immense skill, as she prepares a delicious tapestry of New Orleans dishes—with zero fuss and maximum flavor. Make a hearty start with fresh-baked bread and cultured Poirier’s cane butter. Then dive into a platter of silky oysters Dauphine, tailed by blackened soft-shell crab with creamed Prairie Ronde rice. Carry on carb loading at dessert with dark chocolate crémeux and vanilla rice pudding—you won't be sorry.
"
79,"Obelisk attracts a surprisingly young, casual crowd for a spot that has been serving a fixed five-course menu five nights a week since 1987. It's likely due to the restaurant’s warm, neighborhood feel. The light and seasonal Italian cooking begins with a bang, as an assortment of fantastic antipasti is quickly ushered to the table: perhaps creamy burrata imported from Lazio or a hot croquette filled with melting cheese. Dishes are never fussy and are presented simply, with honest flavors and purposeful ingredients. Entrées might include a dorade with a cracker-crisp sear, served with nutty romesco sauce and green chickpeas. All breads and desserts are made in-house. Don't expect to dash in; the full experience is worth the two to three hours.
"
80,"There is serious heart to be had at the centre of the city, thanks to Chef Pepe Moncayo's elegant spot, where novel ingredients are brilliantly weaved into the ""concept"" menu. What emerges is a sumptuous mashup of dishes with Spanish and Japanese influence. The space is cavernous, modern, yet inviting—with a polished bar, black-tile floors, and sultry metals. Most go for the ""kaiseki,"" but à la carte items are well worth their weight. From a sake-infused chawanmushi with pickled watermelon, ajo blanco featuring a pearly white scallop with mustard seeds, to a single oyster tempura, this team hits every nuanced flavor out of the park.Inspired desserts, like an ube popsicle sprinkled with coconut and draped in chocolate, bring your meal to a meteoric finish.
"
81,"Pandemic delays are in the rear view window for Chef Nicholas Stefanelli's latest venture. Fronted by plate glass windows that reveal its glitzy interior, this corner space is done up with a modern Aegean look that includes polished concrete floors donning rugs for a bit of warmth, seats dressed with linen cushions, an earthy color palette, and woven ceiling pendants that dangle overhead.The Greek cuisine reflects the chef's heritage and features a contemporary accent. Meals begin and end with carefully crafted dishes that are presented as a prix-fixe. The latter may unveil a choice of pastas like mantia tossed with brown butter; vegetables like wild mushrooms with oregano and feta; and proteins, such as seared daurade with fava bean purée and Swiss chard.
"
82,"This buzzy operation is located in DC's brand new Midtown Center; once home to <i>The Washington Post</i>. Comprised of a bar, tables and a dining counter, the space is large yet inviting. The perfectly calibrated lighting shows off the room's pretty faces. Gorgeous appointments, including a volcanic stone installation cascading from the ceiling, ivy-covered wall and a space enveloped in richly toned wood, are equally dazzling.Well-made drinks, an impressive listing of Japanese whiskey and a range of succulent Japanese fare highlighting robata-grilled preparations and sushi are the order of the day. Start off with the Toki old fashioned to accompany dishes that includes prawn and black cod gyoza, skewered chicken wings, soft-shell crab maki and yuzu cheesecake.
"
83,"Chef José Andrés' ocean-blue ode to the cuisine of Greece, Lebanon, and Turkey means an ample, wide-ranging carte. The space too, sleek and modern, speaks to the ease and elegance of the Mediterranean. It's an ideal spot for suits sealing deals, as well as solo diners or friends catching up. Mezze is the menu's focus and the quality of food is solid. Zero in on the mushroom kapnista with dates, walnuts, and labneh for richness. There are a myriad of spreads to be paired with fresh pita, followed by salads and flatbreads (or pide), which are of the dive-right-in variety. Vegetarians will revel in the diversity of dishes, while braised lamb is the Sunday roast everyone deserves.Greek and Lebanese labels are given their due on the exceptional wine list.
"
84,"In a city revered for its high-end dining and enticing global cooking, this relative newcomer is a beacon of Levantine cooking. Guests here are accommodated in a vast, light-flooded space made ultra-comfy with plush carpets, velvet-upholstered chairs and stunning light fixtures. An inviting bar merely enhances the mood.These dishes are refined versions of traditional delicacies and products are immaculate, as evidenced by the mezze, complete with pickled red cabbage, tahini and refreshingly tart yogurt. The piping-hot truffle manakish is a fragrant staple thanks to za’atar, feta and garlic; while sucuk with onion-thyme jam or cold-smoked mackerel with sumac-spiced cream deserve their own fan following. Finish with a cup of mirra and pistachio baklava.
"
85,"Pull up a chair at this intimate restaurant where portraits line the walls and everyone feels like family. Joselito’s offers a spectrum of appealing Spanish favorites that are doled out with extra love. In fact, this kitchen even encourages you to order based on your appetite: go for the tapa portion to sample a wide variety or commit to a larger portion if you’ve spent the morning spinning.These talented chefs aren’t forging a new path; instead, they’re cooking only with the most top-notch ingredients and tender, loving care. Start things off with the velvety smooth chicken liver terrine before tucking in to the creamy delicious “pasta” topped with jumbo crab, sea urchin, pimiento and shrimp. Finish with sopa de chocolate blanco for a decadent treat.
"
86,"From its historic marble lobby and enchanting design details (think velvet chairs and regal gold hues) to a versatile and well-executed menu, everything about this hotel restaurant is quite unforgettable. A lover of all things local and luxurious, Chef Patrick Curran delivers a hit with the elegant Cafe Riggs.Start with a caviar grilled cheese, which is no doubt an over-the-top creation but worth every splurge. For something more classic and local, sample the chilled crab with pickled celery and mustard; while special ""plant based"" items like artichoke hearts or squash with kale and cranberry are deliciously wholesome. In lieu of dessert, go for a smoothie or juice, both of which share prominent real estate on this diverse menu.
"
87,"The team behind Rose’s Luxury and Pineapple and Pearls is also behind this ""little pearl."" Its youthful vibe and carriage house mien make for a nice contrast. There is an enjoyable dichotomy in the dining room by way of historic elements from the original structure mixed in with updated design details. Seats are close together, but the space is very inviting even as the volume of chatter increases. Chef Aaron Silverman’s cooking focuses on modern, seasonal fare starring approachable ingredients that merely add to their signature affable, yet fanciful, style. Behold the pumpkin schnitzel with sauce grenobloise or the angel eggs. The multicourse tasting menu clocks in well under $100; and the eclectic wine list makes it absolutely worth adding a pairing.
"
88,"This revered dining fixture draws a diverse crowd—from locals and politicos to celebrities and tourists. Everyone is here for the classic Southern cooking that is likely to conjure up many a nostalgic memory. Light walls, bronze accents and tropical greenery give the place a bright and fresh feel, but clearly it's all about the food, with a menu that reads like a delicious lesson in history and culture.Start off with the fried chicken livers accompanied by a mustard-soy emulsion. Then tuck into a steaming and fragrant bowl of Carolina gumbo floating with chicken, andouille, okra and shrimp. Cap it all off with a thick wedge of red velvet cake. If you're thinking Low Country cooking in the heart of the Capitol, you're starting to get the picture.
"
89,"Located on the edge of the National Mall within earshot of the Library of Congress, this handsome restaurant has been a hot spot for the after-work crowd ever since it opened. An expansive book of wines—many of them from California—and a wide selection of charcuterie as well as cheese lure those happy hour masses, but it’s the bigger plates that keep patrons in their seats.There is a certain easy-breezy vibe to the menu, which paints broad strokes offering everything from pizza to steak to pasta, but quality and care are considered at every turn. Pillowy gnocchi tossed with caramelized onions and blue cheese is the very definition of comfort and indulgence. Not far behind, house-made ice creams (ask for roasted banana) make for a gratifying finale.
"
90,"Chef José Andrés has opened locations of this tapas hangout from Las Vegas to Chicago to Dubai, but it all started here inside the Beltway. Unafraid of color and pattern, the expansive interior is a riot of glass, tile, hardwood and art, and the vibe is never dull or low energy.Sangria, vermouth and sherry make for wise starts before digging in to an expansive menu of Spanish favorites. Tables can make entire meals out of cured meats, cheeses and crispy fritters; but bigger plates like paella Valenciana with rabbit; gazpacho with goat cheese; and grilled pork sausage with white beans are also worthy orders. We’re just as happy to go simple with a sandwich, featuring a flauta finished with tomato, garlic, olive oil and Ibérico ham.

Make your way down a few stairs to arrive at a freshly minted space, fitted out with stripped banquettes, curved booths, and a row of tables down the center of the dining side.Patrons can expect a span of East African flavors that extend beyond the Kenyan roots of Chef/owner Kevin Onyona. The Swahili Basket is a great way to sample such apps as samosas and bhajias (vegetable fritters) served with a lethal pilipili sauce. Mbuzi mchuzi, a richly spiced goat stew, is best sopped up by rice pilaf; and who can turn down spinach cooked in coconut milk? Large portions make it ideal for a weekend feast.

It is tall, dark and handsome: picture industrial-height ceilings with exposed air ducts and a moody-broody color scheme.Beer is big here, with more than 20 on draft and arranged by flavor profile (tart/funky and fruit/spice are just two). At lunch, pick a meat (turkey breast, porchetta or beef döner), then take your tigelle or flatbread and smoosh it all together. At night, the menu steers offbeat and may include crawfish hush puppies, beer-brined rotisserie duck or smoked pork with mezcal-baked beans. Charcuterie is also creative, unveiling absinthe-lime rillettes and negroni-inspired Campari-rosemary salami.

100,"This gem is a memorable dining destination with cooking that is ambitious yet whimsical. The small space is sure to fill up with an animated crowd, but the ambience is always pleasant. The prix-fixe menu includes beverage pairings, but guests at the bar may order drinks à la carte. The dishes spark interest. It may start with a pristine sea scallop with diced kohlrabi, dressed tableside with a brown butter sabayon, then perhaps a monkfish en papillote atop creamy Carolina Gold rice.Invention is also a point of pride here, best seen in the baton of ""French toast"" that combines foie gras, blue cheese and black truffles.

The space hums with guests gathered around linen-robed tables; yet, there is not a hint of pretense.The menu is loosely French but with a number of detours, from steak tartare and Rohan duck breast to black truffle risotto and Maine lobster with pineapple. The Ora King salmon coulibiac is a signature for good reason—featuring layers of mushroom duxelles and herbed rice wrapped in puff pastry and served with sauce mousseline.

Patrons come to linger over French-influenced meals enjoyed over multiple courses.Pan-seared foie gras atop duck confit and paired with eau de vie-soaked cherries, or grilled quail over a warm artichoke salad are certainly French inspired. Curried butternut squash soup with apple, black sesame and toasted cashew or enoki mushroom-topped halibut over parsnip purée speak to an entirely different influence.

113,"This stunning haven is certainly one for the books. Hugging the Potomac River with unparalleled views, it may be difficult to find a more beautiful setting in town. Of course, those lovely sights come at a price, so expect a bill more palatable to the expense-account type.The service team is one well-orchestrated machine, while Italian-leaning seafood is Executive Chef Anton Bolling's dictum. A plump Capital oyster floats in a zabaglione of prosecco; while liquid cacio e pepe with escarole, sheep's milk cheese and toasted peppercorns is an unexpected thrill.

Arranged around a roaring hearth, the space features an inviting bar at one end and chef's counter at the other.Albi is a sterling example of open-fire cooking at its best. À la carte is one way to go, but guests may just do better with the hyper-seasonal prix-fixe. Regardless, Chef/owner Michael Rafidi's dishes are full of surprises as he weaves in the flavors of the eastern Mediterranean with a myriad of local ingredients. Favorites like baba ghanoush and kefta are handled with precision, but the tastiest dishes come from the wood-fired hearth, imbued with smoke and char.

There is an ace lineup of sips; while the Caribbean fare by ex-Maydān duo (Gerald Addison and Chris Morgan) as well as Jamaican-born Chef Nico Leslie is spot on.

Just be sure it includes brisket, pulled pork and beef ribs. A side of collard greens simply enhances the feast.

Exposed brick, frosted-glass light fixtures, and floral wallpaper are also on display, not to mention closely packed tables with a ledge for votive candles and wine bottles.The menu is small and focused; the cooking classical and comforting. Imagine such familiar items as a dry-aged burger enrobed by melted American cheese and served with potato wedges, to brown butter-roasted fennel laid atop a white bean purée and garnished with pink peppercorns. Although unlisted, the Porterhouse is a particular highlight that pairs well with a sip from the eclectic wine or cocktail list.
"
137,"To find food this tasty in a rather touristy neck of the woods is a welcome surprise. A setting that boasts views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and Hudson River is unique enough that they could probably get away with less than this very good Italian-ish food.In warmer months, the best seats are out on the patio amid blinking harbor lights and a gorgeous vista. A tastefully subdued dining room and unpretentious service make it a pleasant place to while away an evening.This is a kitchen that cuts no corners, especially in the superb potato gnocchi coated in a silky tomato ragù with braised meatballs. Melanzane alla Sorrentina features layers of mozzarella, basil, chunky tomato sauce and thick slices of fried eggplant.
"
138,"Fans of this well-regarded poke bowl operation will be happy enough at lunch, but the owners of the spot have a lot more in mind for the rest of us, especially the after-work crowd of FiDi. The menu offers a little bit of everything in an intimate, sleek space decked out with light oak tables, moody spotlights, and vibrant greenery lining the side of the room.Tempura and yakitori are the strong suits here: maitake mushrooms and chrysanthemum leaves arrive lightly battered and impressively grease-less, while skewers of chicken skin and chicken wings are carefully grilled until finely charred and appropriately tender. Uni lovers will want to try the risotto, which resembles a bowl of warm porridge, finished with finely minced chives and shiso.
"
139,"Buttermilk Channel is the sort of joint we’d all like to have at the end of our street. It’s warm and relaxed, run with care and attention, offers an appealing menu for all occasions—and has prices that encourage regular attendance. The name may refer to the tidal strait but also evokes feelings of comfort and cheer in a place that’s already cute and where the close-set tables and large bar both add to the animated atmosphere.The kitchen seeks out worthy suppliers and with no little skill imbues each creation with that little extra something, be it the cod with Littleneck clams, fresh linguini tossed with beets or indeed the buttermilk-fried chicken. This care is even evident at weekend brunches in standouts like the short rib hash.
"
140,"Thanks to reclaimed wood, vintage lighting and a garage door façade, Chef Eduard Frauneder’s sweet little spot has been cleverly designed to not look too designed. It’s a good choice for a date, the choice of area notwithstanding; and the communal table in the middle, used mostly for walk-ins, adds to its affability.This Austrian restaurant dishes up well-executed Viennese classics that are the stuff of comfort food dreams. The kitchen has an assured yet light touch with traditional dishes—don't miss the spätzle, a light and tender rendition bathed in a cream sauce enriched with Gruyère. The rustic, handmade apple strudel delights with its delicate, buttery deliciousness. Thankfully, judicious pricing means you'll still have some shillings left.
"
141,"Sequestered within the sprawling Le District, L'Appart is not so much a dining room as a crown jewel. Designed to resemble a Parisian apartment, a meal here feels like attending a dinner party. You will be handed a drink as you enter and then introduced to Chef Nicolas Abello. The team clearly makes use of the surrounding boulangerie, fromagerie, poissoinnerie and boucherie, thereby pushing the barriers of classic French cuisine.Kick off with artistic canapés that warm up your taste buds. Then it's on to the entrées made using all manner of modern technique. Think panko-crusted scallop with beurre blanc; or sweetbreads with shiitake mushrooms. Flavors are unapologetically rich but always on point—as in the mini praline soufflé with praline ice cream.
"
142,"This quaint and adorable nook—with small tables set shoulder-to-shoulder—is poised on the waterfront and overlooks the river. Inside, the space is homey and scattered with patrons perusing the limited yet tempting menu. Italian leanings dominate most dishes turned out of the adept kitchen, including pappardelle floating in a parmesan broth with tender ham hock and collards, as well as hearty arancini finished with saffron honey. Other highlights like hot chicken milanese served with crunchy radicchio, and hake with a vibrant green garlic sauce showcase a delightful union of flavors and textures.Oenophiles can also be found appreciating the concise yet thoroughly crafted wine selection, which celebrates top producers and back vintages.
"
143,"Named ""ugly"" to avoid tempting fate, this Thai baby is in fact bright and cheery. Warm smiles and a convivial vibe dominate the room, decked out with colorfully streaked walls and wooden furniture. It's a wildly successful operation thanks to the authentic nature of its cuisine—fiery spice, vibrant flavors and bright raw ingredients being some of the classic hallmarks. While the heat is turned up for most dishes here, servers are quick to keep water glasses full and heated palates cool.The menu spans the nation's specialties, honing in on such rare items as tum kanoon (young jackfruit) paired with pork belly and curry paste. Pig is also king in the fiery kang hoh (with mung bean noodles and Chinese long beans) and subtly spiced curried rice with ginger.
"
144,"SAGA is the crown of 70 Pine Street, a landmark tower that rises over 60 stories. The space is unique and features an open-air balcony where an aperitif can be enjoyed alongside the stunning views. The elegant dining rooms are set with furnishings upholstered in peach and emerald velvet, green marble tables and carved stone accents.Chef James Kent never allows his cuisine to be overshadowed by the setting, however. Along with his talented team, he presents diners with compositions that embrace luxury, seasonality and urbane inspiration. Caviar and foie gras are on tap, as is seafood with laksa sauce or a duck preparation influenced by the chef's Moroccan background. Dinner may run long, but with good pacing one hardly notices.
"
145,"Great views and good food rarely go hand in hand, but this stylish USHG spot breaks that trend. Set in an iconic skyscraper, now owned by a Chinese company, and set some 60 floors up, this team understands that eventually even the most enthusiastic voyeur looks down at their plate, so the stellar views are more like an added bonus.The best seats in the house face the display kitchen, where classic French cooking is the mainstay. These chefs know when to leave a dish alone so there’s nothing on the plate that isn’t serving a purpose. A rich matzah ball soup composed with chicken broth, onions and carrots; followed by buttery turbot with grapes and almonds are standouts. For dessert, look no further than the soufflé with a decadent butterscotch sauce.
"
146,"Wolfgang Puck shot to fame after opening LA’s Spago in 1982, and it wasn’t long before he reached megabrand status. CUT by Wolfgang Puck is by far his most expansive venture, with six outposts spanning the globe. The Manhattan locale is tucked at the base of the swanky downtown Four Seasons Hotel, and sports a fittingly elegant look with deep magenta chairs, floor-to-ceiling marigold draperies and lovely artwork from the chef’s private collection.Kick things off with Puck’s signature tuna tartare studded with ginger, avocado and shallots, then brought to elegant new heights with wasabi aïoli, more avocado and togarashi crisps. Wagyu arrives charred to caramelized perfection, sporting a gorgeous rosy medium-rare center and graced by béarnaise.
"
147,"Set back off the main road in what resembles a used-car lot, first-timers here may not be entirely sure they’re in the right place until they reach the front door. However, the inside of this Azerbaijani restaurant is homey. Built out of heavy wood beams, the wide room is set with sturdy picnic tables designed for crowds. And that is exactly what you’ll need to take in the full breadth of the menu, which boasts tender, smoky skewers served with fluffy rice; comforting bowls of borscht thickened with yogurt; and fried “ravioli” stuffed with lamb. Looking for veggies? Try the smoked eggplant salad chock full of peppers.Servers are matter-of-fact, especially if they think you’ve ordered too much food. But no matter, as it makes for lovely leftovers.
"
148,"Little Park flaunts that upscale downtown feel that TriBeCa seems to have trademarked. Yet it delivers a personal and unique cuisine that distinguishes it from other Andrew Carmellini restaurants. Here, vegetables are often spotlighted, with meat and seafood serving as accents. This means that the harmonious flavors of beet tartare with rye crumbs and smoked trout roe are just as impressive as the equal parts playful and thrilling Sullivan County chicken, starring a savory garam masala-infused tamarind sauce. Masterful desserts include the frozen Meyer lemon “fluff” with meringue and orange sorbet.The bar is perpetually buzzing as the bold cocktail program operates on a high level, so diners looking for peace and quiet should steer clear.
"
149,"Chef Marc Forgione’s eponymous restaurant is as busy and as vibrant as ever, packed with an endless stream of downtown denizens who’ve been coming here since doors opened in 2008. Forgione’s impressive tenure is a testament to his consistency and to his bold style that takes inspiration from all over, like the crispy sushi rice draped in Hamachi or wild nettle lumache paired with escargot and guanciale. Dining with a group? The Snowdance Farms chicken under a brick will dwarf the entire table and is comfort cooking at its finest. All the while, flickering candles produce more atmosphere than light for a room clad in exposed brick and salvaged wood. Veteran servers dressed in black take their cues and seem to disappear into the background.
"
150,"This neighborhood seafood favorite arrives courtesy of Chefs Alex Raij and Eder Montero, who also run next-door La Vara. The narrow space may not at all match the kitchen’s outsized talents and imaginative plates, which feature global ingredients with vibrant flavors. Sharing might be encouraged but that might prove difficult after the first few bites. Stick to the sea, by way of the fluke ceviche with leche de tigre and fried saltines or flaky fish empanadas with a fiery aji sauce. Lobster roll with yuzu mayo tempts but do save room for the jerk yellowtail collar, which arrives brilliantly grilled, charred, and paired with coconut rice and slaw.The interesting wine list is arranged by the sea that lines the coast where the grapes are grown.
"
151,"Even on a Monday, this Laotian hot spot will pack in the crowds clamoring for vibrant, family-style dishes brimming with tart and spicy notes. So unless you’re stopping by during lunch for market bowls made with lemongrass chicken or ginger prawns or picking up a hen of the woods mushroom banh mi, good luck landing a table without a reservation. Sizeable appetizers like Berkshire pork spring rolls or spare ribs with long bean and papaya salad grace practically every table. The entrées only get bigger: Wide rice noodles with bits of slow-cooked pork swim in a cauldron of coconut yellow curry with herbs and bean sprouts, while chicken salad with herbs and toasted rice makes for a solid side.Service is hurried, so don’t expect much handholding.
"
152,"This ever-trendy yet refined Italian ristorante is as much coveted for its gorgeous setting as its lineup of rustic, tasty fare. The ambience is always abuzz and everyone looks beautiful amid low lights, a long bar, and walls adorned with wine bottles.Breakfast verges on divine—think lemon pancakes and black-and-white banana monkey bread. Bare tables are packed throughout the day with a stylish crowd waxing poetic about crostini topped with blue crab and jalapeño. Also try terrific house-made pastas such as the mezze rigatoni tossed in a creamy white veal bolognese-style sauce, or the hanger steak with pickled red chili and charred onions. No one should leave without sampling the superb sweets—the creative cinnamon torta is a gorgeous hit. 
"
153,"The name says it all—Tiny’s is indeed tiny, but in that old New York, wood-burning fire and pressed-tin ceiling kind of way. Enter this narrow Federal-style home (c. 1810) and sidle up to the beautiful people along the pew seats that overlook a poster of the Marlboro Man. Alternatively, head on up to the suitably named Bar Upstairs.The setting is so rich with character that one could simply be satisfied by Tiny’s fine burger, featuring dry-aged rib-eye and a side of cheddar tater tots. However, this is a surprisingly ambitious kitchen turning out some very clever dishes. The wild Coho salmon for example, is grilled to specification and plated with vadouvan-spiced beurre blanc; while the vanilla flan slicked with cold caramel syrup makes a wonderful finale.
"
154,"It’s easy to see why The Odeon has been a part of the fabric of TriBeCa life for so long. Like watching a re-run of Seinfeld, it is reassuringly familiar, classically New York and, even when you know what’s coming next, still eminently satisfying. The menu is a roll-call of everyone’s favorites, from chicken paillard to beet salad, burgers to cheesecake. Cocktails are well made and beers carefully poured. Dishes are executed with sufficient care and portions are of manageable proportions.The room comes with an appealing art deco feel and the terrace at the front pulls in the occasional passerby. Service is personable and willing too, although after all this time the place could probably run itself.
"
155,"No expense was spared in the design of restaurateur Andrew Carmellini's Italian chophouse, located at Pier 17 in the South Street Seaport, where a bustling horseshoe-shaped bar anchors the ground floor and a team of sharply dressed servers manage the upstairs dining room, outfitted with Tuscan leather banquettes, Venetian mirrors and charming views of the East River.The Sorrento arancini are redolent of lemon, octopus carpaccio is enhanced with crispy pepperoni, and salads prepared tableside all signal a more thoughtful approach than most other menus in this genre. High quality steaks are seasoned and cooked deftly; and among the many cuts and sizes, the unique gorgonzola-cured Wagyu strip loin is certainly a highlight.
"
156,"Building Tamarind cost a cool five million, and it shows—every inch of this soaring space oozes with grandeur. With its classic TriBeCa edifice and gorgeous marble bar (an ideal perch for post-work indulgence), the glass-fronted behemoth draws a posh crowd of Wall Streeters and well-heeled locals.Most impressive of all is the sleek display kitchen, outfitted with a gleaming tandoor that turns out exceptional Mughlai food like sirkha gosht (lamb in a fiery chili and coriander chutney). Malai halibut, roasted then blanketed in a coconut-ginger sauce with toasted cumin seeds, is a standout. While service is mediocre at best and the kitchen may fall behind at peak times, mains like kolambi pola (prawns in a coconut-and-chili curry) make up for any gaffes.
"
157,"This bakery-café headed by the talented Daniel Eddy is an exceptionally perch for bread fans. Nestled in a semi-commercial strip in Park Slope and flanked by restaurants, stores and verdant Prospect Park, it boasts a ""winning"" location and culinary repertoire.Regulars know to get here early to score Pastry Chef Ali Spahr and team's house-made goodies. Correspondingly, freshly baked English muffins, baguettes, and boules turned out by master baker Kevin Bruce will have you begging for more. Breakfast sandwiches are a bestseller for good reason, but return at lunch for seriously savory fare, like a vegetable bahn mi with smoked portobellos or an elevated grilled cheese with Jasper Hill Farm Alpha Tolman, cheddar, provolone, romesco and much, much more.
"
158,"Waterfront dining is a rare treat on the island of Manhattan, so when Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten launched this dining room at Pier 17, New Yorker's came a calling. Having taken its name from the city's iconic fish market, formerly housed here, seafood is the menu's driving force. The space features hand-painted murals, plush furnishings, and a rich color palette.Flaunting breezy alfresco dining as well as gorgeous views of the East River and Brooklyn Bridge, this bi-level retreat however never falls short in the food part. In fact, you'll discover a solid menu, which casts its gaze on crudos, iced shellfish platters and simply grilled fillets. Entreés like roasted monkfish or spice-crusted salmon have diners planning their return.
"
159,"The word “Farra” has several meanings, all of which would be appropriate for this sleek retreat. Attractive, fun, and a bona fide party, Farra is a full-fledged restaurant that promises to garner a cultish following. With no charcuterie, cheese plates, or paninis in sight, diners can rest assured of savory, sumptuous cooking.Sharing the same wine cellar (and former sous chef) with next-door Atera, the team shows similar levels of hospitality, attention to detail, and creativity. Maybe you’ve had salmon tartare before, but was it mixed with potato chips for crunch and served with nori? We've all had ravioli, but what about the crown-shaped corona ripiena? Stuffed with lobster, ricotta, and set in a dashi broth, this course is in a league of its own.
"
160,"Counter dining can sometimes mean lots of elbows; fortunately, this one is large enough to ensure you’re sufficiently secluded, while still letting you enjoy the immersive experience. Danish chef Ronny Emborg and team serve up a menu of courses that progress from light and subtle to rich and robust. Things are certainly grown-up here, with such fully realized dishes as a rye cracker piped with ham and topped with crisped chicken skin; or a potato dumpling smartly dressed with parmesan foam. Paper-thin Wagyu shavings may then be enhanced with a pour of hot dried shrimp bouillon and confit quail egg yolk.There may be some tweezer action as the chefs assemble their beguiling plates, but that also means there’s nowhere to hide when food is this precise.
"
161,"Now under the command of Chef Shion Uino, this quiet sushi-ya features prized, beautiful seafood sourced primarily from Japan. Never, at any point, does it look like the chef is cutting from a filet he’s already sliced. The product is whole and luscious every time, which is all the more reason why the nigiri sees little beyond a dot of wasabi or a dab of nikiri.Fish are sliced methodically, and the rice is consistently warm and vinegared. Regulars, of which there are many, are treated to special pieces throughout the evening and will recognize some of his signature dishes, like hairy crab dressed with Japanese black vinegar, as well as his unrivaled tamago, which tastes as perfect as it looks. An extensive uni tasting is a testament to his sourcing.
"
162,"This ambitious operation has a clear sense of purpose. Its name refers to the two stones used to grind grain; the location is just blocks from where the city’s first tidewater grist mill once stood; and a Per Se alum heads the bakery. Inside, the theme continues with walls constructed of concrete blocks shaped like flour sacks.Lunchtime sandwiches showcase house-baked breads, like whole wheat pain au lait grilled with cheddar and pickled peppers; or falafel-inspired broccoli fritters in a warm pita with harissa and walnut-yogurt sauce. Come dinner, the homemade pastas or fish of the day, like seared local porgy with olive romesco, impress. Desserts however are the real showstoppers, as evidenced by a bronzed raspberry cobbler with creamy corn ice cream.
"
163,"Oaxaca by way of Gowanus? When it’s this seriously delicious, you bet. Brought to you courtesy of Chef T.J. Steele, this Mexican charmer was an instant hit. Locals were particularly quick to head to the restaurant's breezy backyard, where groups take to the clever mezcal-focused cocktail list. Of course, as word of the delicious food got out, even more fans started to follow.The interior is small and features a warming, wood-fired oven, bar up front, a smattering of tables, as well as a garden complete with its own kitchen. Service is bright, friendly and accessible, but the real draw is their excellent Oaxacan dishes, rendered true to their classical roots in some and then spun with creative riffs in others. For instance, barbacoa is a point of pride in this kitchen, which only cooks so much of it daily, so plan to get here early if you intend to feast on this popular item. Savory barbacoa tacos are then laced with spicy green salsa and paired with a bowl of soulful consommé. Other high points include tender seared octopus with bacon and pickled chilies piled onto tortillas.Don’t forget about the humble black beans though, as they boast a deliciously addictive combo of smoke and heat.
"
164,"Inspired by the word ""husmanskost"" meaning “everyday food"" in Norwegian, this delightful little offering arrives courtesy of Chef/owner Ned Baldwin. Set just around the corner from the legendary Ear Inn, it sports a small, but sharply designed interior, replete with schoolhouse chairs and reclaimed bowling alley wood tables.This menu is all about simplicity and seasonality. Dinner may begin with a selection of bread accompanied by rabbit rillettes or a fava purée with olives, almonds and chilies. Charred carrots with ricotta, pumpkin seeds, and honey make an ideal companion to the juicy roasted chicken with sweet potatoes, cashews, and rosemary. Close out with a decadent peanut tart, along with a classic cider, cocktail, or even Kölsch from Cologne.
"
165,"Zinc bar, marble floors, burgundy leather banquettes—it’s textbook brasserie with a smattering of art deco finesse. Frenchette arrives courtesy of Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, veterans of some of the city's most beloved brasseries, and this duo has perfected their Parisian-laced panache.This place is so much more than good looks, though. Begin with brouillade, a plate filled with scrambled eggs framing a pool of Peconic snails and—you guessed it—garlic butter. Traditional sweetbreads sport a crisp shell masking the smooth interior and are served in a savory jus studded with poached crayfish and spring peas. Savor a flaky mille feuille before bidding this delightful kitchen adieu.The wine list is a thoughtful collection of affordable natural European wines.
"
166,"Located just below street level on frenetic Atlantic Avenue, a nondescript façade holds a quiet den of serious Neapolitan pizza magic. Enter and you’ll find a simple, narrow, wood-paneled room with whitewashed brick walls; a little bar showcasing a handful of wines; an enormous, two-ton clay oven (imported directly from Naples); and a little patio out back for alfresco dining.The mood is decidedly relaxed, and while there are delicious salads, antipasti and desserts to be tried at Sottocasa, the name of the game here is undoubtedly their wickedly good pizza, served folded, bianche or rosse (with—hurrah!—a gluten-free option as well). Regulars adore the Diavola pie, which comes laced with excellent mozzarella, fresh basil, black olives and hot sopressata.
"
167,"This delightfully named operation (PDA is short for public display of affection) is a fitting reflection of the owners' (Robert and, sister, Emi Guimond) charming vision. Pizza is far from a novelty in NYC, but this venture boasts the sort of success that other area spots can only dream of. The space is snug and inviting, with natural wood and beautiful lighting. Slow-fermented sourdough is the secret behind their excellent pies, featuring such responsibly sourced ingredients as roasted carrots with citrus butter and Bourbon, Brussels sprouts, and mushrooms. Yet pizza isn't the only draw; rotating appetizers keep company with such beloved entrées as meatballs in a luscious tomato sauce.For those racing to catch the R, PDA offers breakfast from 7:00 AM.
"
168,"Boerum Hill’s most bodacious deli serves up killer smoked meats among other treats whose caloric content rivals a week’s worth of eating. This is Montreal Jewish fare, the stuff comfort food dreams are made of. Think of thin slices of corned beef piled high, topped with kraut and Russian dressing, blanketed in melted Swiss and wedged between toasted pumpernickel. Side dishes are as serious as the main ones, like that Canadian classic poutine, finished in a number of ways, including cheese curds, gravy, eggs, and even chicken schnitzel. Still hungry? They have hot dogs.The tiny space gets lots of traffic, so those who can’t find a seat along the counter or trio of communal tables can feast at home with takeout procured from the sidewalk window.
"
169,"Welcome to a realm of understated elegance at this ground-floor restaurant of The Dominick hotel in Hudson Square. Vestry is a foolproof destination for guests craving a quiet evening in an intimate setting that fortunately also prepares truly gratifying cuisine. In terms of décor, envision handsome herringbone-laid plank floors, luxe leather seats, and billowing fabric-draped windows. Then throw in a pop of greenery by way of potted plants for a happy marriage between exotica and earthiness.The bar is a gleaming perch, not unlike the dining room, which offers a seafood- and vegetable-focused menu, replete with global inflections. Steering this kitchen's reigns is chef extraordinaire, Shaun Hergatt, so diners can expect nothing less than food art. The shiitake handroll employs wasabi leaf instead of nori and makes for a cool, natural, and zesty bite. Pescatarians will exult in the salt-cured ocean trout paired with nashi pear for a sweet and savory affair; or black seabream seared to golden crisp before being enriched by a spiced yuzu-kosho sauce.Close on the heels of these savory treats is a finale of Tahitian vanilla-and-star anise semifreddo, cloaked by deep-purple mountain huckleberries.
"
170,"Chef Victoria Blamey, aided by a small but talented team, impresses diners with a range of unique cuisine that brims with personality. Finding the alley entrance may pose a challenge for even the most knowledgeable New Yorker, but that's part of the fun (spoiler alert: it's housed within the Walker Tribeca hotel). The dining room is cozy yet chic, with simple white walls, large windows dressed with cafe curtains, mosaic tile flooring, blue banquettes and a small marble bar counter.A four-course prix-fixe offers an array of plates. Options may include a pristine sea scallop dressed with a vibrant winter squash-enriched leche de tigre; or plump mussels arranged with charred cabbage and accompanied by a slice of excellent bread for sopping up the onion broth.
"
171,"This husband-and-wife operation, marked by a yellow-awning and large windows that look out onto the street, is a forward-thinking local favorite. Serving rustic food to an ever-changing neighborhood, this kitchen caters to that special, old-school sort of diner—who may be found lunching on trippa alla Toscana (tender honeycomb tripe served with crusty sourdough) or insalata di farro with roasted beets and spinach. Tables may also be full of pastas like paccheri with pork shoulder ragù, parmesan, and goat cheese for ultimate deliciousness; tailed by a perfect pear tart to seal your meal. The high-ceilinged room feels a bit faded chic, but that's just part of the charm. Elaborate chandeliers and intricate wall art certainly help things along.
"
172,"Some things in life are worth dressing up for, and a visit to the illustrious River Café is certainly one of them. It enjoys, without question, one of the greatest settings of any restaurant, lying as it does in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. In fact, the cityscape views are so spectacular, the ordering of a Manhattan as your pre-prandial cocktail seems the only obvious choice.The entire place also oozes romance. A regiment of experienced, white-jacketed waitstaff keep the whole operation ticking along like the well-oiled machine it is—and they can probably spot an impending marriage proposal even before the potential groom has left his seat.However, don’t come thinking that the food here will be playing second fiddle to the stellar views. In fact, it provides the perfect match for the setting. The ingredients are top-notch and the kitchen team has an inherent understanding of what goes with what—imagine succulent pork belly with scallops for example, or even glistening duck breast with sweet potato spätzle. It also knows that good cooking is not about showing how clever it is but about creating dishes that are at once balanced, easy to eat and eminently satisfying.
"
173,"Owners Amy Besa and Romy Dorotan mix and match Filipino dishes in a distinctly successful way at this neighborhood café. Arguably one of the most fast-growing and intriguing cuisines on both coasts, this outpost from the team behind ""Memories of Philippine Kitchens"" flaunts a smart, urbane mix of local families and savvy gourmands. Sharing is key so you can sample a bit of everything, including pajeon, a delicious Korean-style scallion-and-shrimp pancake. Then linger over the universally loved pancit luglug (call ahead to order); or oxtail kare-kare, braised in a sauce of peanut butter, onions, tomatoes and garlic.The dessert carte may just unveil such enticing treats as champorrado, house-made ice creams and sorbets. Infused shochu is a hit at all times.
"
174,"This hot spot is sequestered into the opulent emporium by noted interior design firm, Roman and Williams. It’s all in the family here, where the principals have partnered with Stephen Starr—the prolific restaurateur behind neighboring Le Coucou—and the chef, Marie-Aude Rose happens to be married to Le Coucou’s very own Daniel Rose.You’ll find the café on one end of the boutique, lined with powder-blue banquettes and tables prettified by delicate blooms. The open kitchen is a sight unto itself, with sage-green tiles and gleaming cookware. The morning menu offers ""eggscellent"" dishes and pastries, while dinner pairs classic French food with enticing sips. Don’t miss the heartwarming bœuf bourguignon united with crispy lardons and soft pearl onions.
"
175,"Sushi Katsuei does Park Slope proud flaunting some of the borough’s best sushi, expertly seasoned and sliced. Humming with locals, families and their kids in tow, the mood here is always upbeat and warm. While the counter appears to be reserved for their regular diners, tables are attended to by a cadre of informed servers. The chefs know their stuff as they showcase quality fish, but the menu is equally well-suited to those who just want a spicy tuna roll or a cooked dish. Most stray from the pedestrian and surrender to the omakase, where you will be rewarded with a parade of elevated sushi and sashimi. Tempura dishes are just as enticing, especially the naturally sweet roasted pumpkin.Prices are fantastic for such high quality food.
"
176,"Everything about this oft-packed and quintessentially SoHo “café” is thoroughly warm and welcoming, thanks to Chef Ignacio Mattos’ passion and desirably personal cuisine. His flavors are elegant and yet surprisingly novel, as may be found in the delicious pasta course unveiling candele cacio e pepe. Diners may then look forward to a straightforward preparation of swordfish, grilled to flaky perfection and matched with charred yellow squash along with pesto Trapanese.One of the kitchen's highlights is the pici al nero di seppia, which showcases long strands of semolina pasta that's tossed in a warming tomato and basil ragù. Then comes dessert, whereby a classic, vanilla-perfumed panna cotta topped with plump Amarena cherries has sweet teeth swooning.
"
177,"EN doesn’t pander to the spicy tuna-loving set, but effectively pays homage to highly seasonal Japanese cooking. In such simple and delicate food, flawless execution is a must so don’t hesitate to ask for a recommendation. Also on offer are three, exceptionally priced kaiseki menus. The informed staff is happy to offer their opinion on items ranging from lobster ishiyaki bathed in bubbling white miso butter and mochi croquette filled with Hudson Valley duck and mashed potato to crunchy vegetable tempura. House-made tofu with a milky, nutty flavor, is served in a wooden box and can be cold or warm, depending on the guest's preference.Lofty ceilings, large windows, and a glass wall lined with shelves of sake attract a fashionable crowd.
"
178,"If you’re going to name your place after a single item of food, you need to have mastered its cooking. Fortunately, Chef/co-owner Mike Price knows exactly how to get the best out of these versatile little tidbits of delight—whether they are grilled in their shells with buttered crumbs or even bobbing away in an impressive New England clam chowder, garnished with dots of herb oil and those classic ""oyster"" crackers.Don’t fall into the trap of thinking, however, that this sweet little corner bistro is in any way gimmicky or one dimensional. In truth, there are plenty of equally appealing, non-clam-specific seafood dishes that also hit the spot, including the baked flounder with peekytoe crab Imperial, green beans, and creamy lemon butter.
"
179,"Thái So´n is by far the best of the bunch in this Vietnamese quarter of Chinatown. It’s neither massive nor fancy, but it’s bright, clean and perpetually in business. One peek at the specials on the walls (maybe golden-fried squid strewn with sea salt) will have you begging for a seat in the crammed room.Speedy servers scoot between groups of City Hall suits and Asian locals as they order the likes of cha gio, pork spring rolls with nuoc cham; or goi cuon, fantastic summer rolls filled with poached shrimp and vermicelli. Naturally, pho choices are abundant, but the real star of the show is pho tai—where raw beef shavings are cooked to tender perfection when combined with a scalding hot, savory broth replete with herbs, sprouts and chewy noodles.
"
180,"There’s nothing like a discreet entrance to raise expectations—and Hirohisa is nicely concealed on Thompson Street. When you do find it, you enter into a stylish, beautifully understated and meticulously laid out room that looks like a page from Wallpaper magazine. It’s run with considerable charm by an unobtrusive and very courteous Japanese team.The two-page menu is easy to decipher with clear  headings. However, you might just be better off giving in and letting the chefs decide by going for the balanced and seasonal dishes from the seven- or nine-course omakase. Two things will quickly become clear: the ingredients are exceptional and the technical skills of the team considerable. This is food that is as rewarding to eat as it is restorative. Standouts include the lingering, complex flavors of Kumamoto oysters wrapped in Wagyu beef carpaccio and topped with Maine sea urchin, perfectly grilled Japanese kinki or anything with their homemade tofu.There are tables available, but it’s so much more satisfying to sit at the counter and engage with the smiling chefs—this way, you may even find that there are a few more dishes in their repertoire than they advertise.
"
181,"This wildly popular joint is still packed to the gills most days, and for good reason: the Cantonese fare and dim sum served here is as good as the food you’ll find in those authentic places in far-flung Queens. Even better, they take reservations—and dim sum orders are taken by the staff, thereby ensuring that the food stays fresh. However, guests should avoid shared tables during the weekend rush as service can verge on chaotic.If the price seems a bit higher than its competitors, you’ll find it’s worth it for dishes like sweet shrimp, rolled in rice paper and laced with dark soy sauce. Plump snow pea leaf dumplings are spiked with vibrant ginger and garlic and may be tailed by rich duck dumplings or an irresistibly flaky roast pork pie.
"
182,"Take one part Chef Daniel Rose, France’s favorite American expat, and add Philadelphia-based power restaurateur Stephen Starr, and you have Le Coucou, with its white-hot scene that’s equal parts classic and cool.Patrons linger late into the night amid plush velvet chairs and custom chandeliers, enjoying exceptional service and a view of the bustling open kitchen. This menu is unapologetically French, though Rose infuses his classics with a strong dose of personality, making powerful traditional dishes that may have fallen by the wayside relevant again. For instance, a selection of “gourmandises” (or more indulgent delicacies) showcases such exemplary classics as pike quenelles or sautéed sweetbreads. The latter achieves prominent flavor when paired with tomato crème, and may be tailed by beef cheek and foie gras terrine in a pitch-perfect sherry vinaigrette.In closing, a venerated rabbit dish is exceptional under the chef’s lead, presented as three acts: gently braised legs in a clear consommé with an array of vegetables; stuffed saddle drizzled with a rustic pan sauce; and the rest matched with delicious mustard-enrobed onions.
"
183,"Chef/owner Giacomo Romano defines this rustic little spot as an alimenteria—a place where patrons can find ever-changing temptations day or night. This may mean a hearty panini or ribollita for lunch or satisfying pasta for dinner. The sunny space is a former antique store that fashions a raw look through whitewashed brick walls and blonde wood tables. Simple, unpretentious food is the focus here, as seen in dishes like insalata di carota, mixing sweet roasted carrots, peppery arugula and pumpkin seeds—grab wedges of bread to soak up its citrusy vinaigrette. Fresh pasta is a must and the pappardelle verdi in a creamy Gorgonzola sauce, for instance, is delicious.Stop by the sliver of an annex next door to pick up a frittata, sandwich or sweet to go.
"
184,"With their roll call of “fashionable” ingredients garnered from all corners of the globe, restaurant menus can sometimes look as though they’ve been put together by a promiscuous explorer rather than an inquisitive chef. But, not all of us always want loquat with our lunch or dashi with our dinner—sometimes we need something that evokes a sense of place and history and Wallsé provides just that.Those, however, who think Austrian food is all Wiener schnitzel and apple strudel should think again, because this cuisine is itself made up of a host of influences, stretching from Italy all the way to the Balkans. Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner and his kitchen also demonstrate how cuisines can evolve to respect contemporary tastes without compromising their integrity. So while there are plenty of classics on offer at all times, including quark spaetzle with succulent, tender rabbit, there are also lighter dishes like cod with squash and chanterelles.This two-roomed restaurant exudes a sense of romance, so if you’re here on a date go full-on Viennese when it comes to dessert by sharing a Sachertorte. The vivid modern canvases are also a welcome change from the anodyne art found in so many places.
"
185,"This age-old dim sum parlor, spread over many floors in an office building, is one of the few Cantonese spots that actually has the space and volume to necessitate its parade of steaming carts brimming with treats. While Golden Unicorn’s system is very efficient and part of the spectacle, arrive early to nab a seat by the kitchen for better variety and hotter items.A helpful brigade of suited men and women roam the space to offer the likes of exquisitely soft roast pork buns, or congee with preserved egg and shredded pork. Buzzing with locals and visitors, it is also a favorite among families who appreciate the kid-friendly scene as much as the delectable, steamed pea shoot and shrimp dumplings, pork siu mai and rice rolls stuffed with shrimp.
"
186,"Named for the street upon which it lives, this intimate ""inn"" has arrived on the scene, thanks to the venerated team of Rita Sodi and Jody Williams. The space has a vintage feel with antiques and warm wood accents. Upon entry, the room opens up—to the right is the superior tavern while the dining room is directly across. Here, linen-clad tables and wooden floors are a nod to minimal Shaker style and set the stage for the early American cuisine. Imagine oysters raw, fried or pickled; rarebit; and hearty chowders. Crave-worthy vegetarian dishes have guests clamoring for more.Close at hand, desserts are less cloying, more gratifying. A ginger cake dressed with sea salt and crème fraîche may be best enjoyed with milk punch (from their strong cocktail carte).
"
187,"This tavern has quickly become the ""it"" spot in SoHo, where one is almost guaranteed to see a line of fashion-forward diners waiting for a chance to tuck into their famously tender and delicious lamb chops. Inside, it's tight but nobody seems to mind. The dining room's white stucco walls and windows set a warm and welcoming vibe, and the bar in the front is just right for a drink or two while waiting for a table. This is not your average Greek restaurant serving the tired old clichés. Instead, the chef infuses a hint of whimsy into each dish and delivers on flavor and quality. Some standouts include spanakopita spring rolls, chicken gyro bao buns, and moussaka with lamb or vegetarian options. Come Sunday for the well-priced supper and half-price wine.
"
188,"Invite plenty of dining companions to share heaping plates of roasted meats and rice and noodle soups at this wallet-friendly treasure. Locals stream in until the 4:00 A.M. closing bell for their great Cantonese dishes—food is clearly the focus here, over the brusque service and unfussy atmosphere. Guests’ gaze quickly pass over the imitation wooden chairs to rest on the crispy skin of suckling pig and ducks hanging in the window.These dishes are huge, so forgo the rice and opt instead for deliciously chewy noodles and barbecue meats. Incredible shrimp wontons, for instance, are delicate and thin; and the complex homemade e-fu noodles demonstrate technique and quality to a standout level that is rarely rivaled.
"
189,"It’s an art form to make delicious food look this easy. Chef/owners Clare de Boer and Jess Shadbolt met working at London's esteemed River Café, then banded together with Annie Shi to open King. The popular bar area leads to an intimate rear dining space lined with bright artwork and gleaming mirrors—the overall effect is a sense of ease that restaurants can take ages to acquire.The kitchen brings a deft touch to their small, daily-changing menu, with ingredients pulled straight from the greenmarket. A tangle of warm tagliarini has gratifying bite, paired with a textured tomato sauce; while perfectly cooked lombatello (Italian for hanger steak) arrives chargrilled over twigs of rosemary, with braised rainbow chard and a lovely anchovy and oregano salsa.
"
190,"The original outpost of the legendary Blue Ribbon empire begins here in SoHo, with Bruce and Eric Bromberg opening this brilliant charmer in 1992 to instant acclaim (and plenty of fellow chef loyalists). Nearly 30 years later, those cozy booths and bar seats remain packed to the gills, namely because of the group's can’t-miss formula—a late-night bistro that serves critically acclaimed food into the wee hours of the morning.This kitchen's highlight reel is long, but don’t miss the incredibly fresh shucked oysters; smoked trout salad, tossed with sour cream and zippy horseradish; or the now-legendary fried chicken with mashed potatoes. Finish with the impossibly good banana-walnut bread pudding, laced with caramel sauce.
"
191,"Of all the restaurants that dot this stretch of SoHo, none are hipper and hotter than Charlie Bird. You’ll be greeted by a blast of beats upon entry, where a long bar leads to the cool brick-lined dining space armed with leather seats.From there, things just take off: along with a clever menu, upbeat service, and a thoughtful wine list brimming with interesting old-world selections, the kitchen delights long before Chef/co-owner Ryan Hardy’s renowned pastas hit your palate. These may include rigatoni with fennel-roasted suckling pig; or spaghetti alla carbonara formed into a nest and topped with buttery spring onions, smoked bacon and a bright yellow duck egg. A warm chocolate budino with olive oil ice cream is insanely creamy and utterly dreamy.
"
192,"Make your way down down an alley, ring the doorbell, and be escorted past a sliding door to arrive at this dark and moody dining room from Chef Kunihide Nakajima. Rather than pops of color, the aesthetic is decidedly stark, black, and tan. Slate floors echo with the sushi master's bamboo sandals, as he glides behind the illuminated counter. Antique cups and bowls on floating shelves behind ease diners into a thoughtful meal with top product and strong technique. Kick off with a few starters, including sashimi; then pivot to delicate sushi like a sliver of mackerel, rich, flaky sea bass, or warm eel brushed with sweet soy.There is a strong focus on the beverage program, with a cocktail tasting (try the smoky Bowery) as well as a whiskey and sake selection.
"
193,"Hwa Yuan gives locals a rather delicious taste of history. Its famed cold noodle recipe dates back to 1968 and is as solid as ever. Owned and operated by the same family since day one, the restaurant has regained its status as a neighborhood delight. The tri-level space evokes Chinatown’s heyday, with helpful service and polished surroundings befit for a fun night out. If Shorty himself is around, ask about the good old days and he might even break out the old photographs.Stick to the menu’s familiar Sichuan dishes for a successful meal. Highlights include pork wontons in a scarlet-red chili oil and garnished with scallions. Long strips of crispy beef may then arrive, tossed in a glossy sauce, laced with vinegar, garlic and just a hint of spice.
"
194,"Beyond this quaint and charming façade lies one of Little Italy’s famed mainstays, ever-popular with dreamy-eyed dates seeking the stuff of Billy Joel lyrics. The expansive space does indeed suggest a nostalgic romance, with its series of Mediterranean-themed rooms, though the most celebrated is the pleasant garden atrium (il cortile is Italian for courtyard), with a glass-paneled ceiling and abundant greenery.A skilled line of cooks presents a wide array of familiar starters and entrées, from eggplant rollatini to chicken Francese; as well as a range of pastas, such as spaghettini puttanesca or risotto con funghi. Several decades of sharing family recipes and bringing men to one bent knee continue to earn Il Cortile a longtime following.
"
195,"Somehow, this warm little Brazilian café has been hiding in plain sight for over two decades. The white room’s clean décor, votive candles and jazz music keep it homey yet fashionable enough for the sophisticated downtown locals who regularly seem to populate it.Come here on a wintry night for a downright perfect bowl of canja di galinha, starring a rustic and flavor-packed chicken soup with string beans, leeks and rice. Alternatively, go for a bowl of tantalizingly spiced feijoada and find the accoutrements as delicious as the main dish itself—you can expect an array of creamy black beans, tangy orange segments, crunchy farofa (fried cassava), collard greens and diabolically hot preserved red peppers. Desserts are appealing and very well priced.
"
196,"The elusive sign, the secretive feel, the tiny space, the keenly priced menu with a plate for every palate—yes, this is the sort of place we’d all like up our sleeve when friends want a recommendation in the Village. It’s warm, welcoming and cozy and you’ll be reluctant to venture back out into the real world afterwards.The jewels are in the cicchetti section, like tender porchetta on crostini; grilled sardines with pine nuts, onions and bags of flavor; as well as deliciously sweet dates stuffed with gorgonzola and wrapped in speck. The pasta dishes aren’t lacking in oomph either; wild boar pappardelle and garganelli osso buco both pack a punch. The only challenge will be finding enough space on your little table for all the food you’ll order.
"
197,"In a city that changes faster than you can go from uptown to down, Raoul’s (open since the 1970s) is a stalwart—here long before SoHo was a brand name. Once inside, order a cocktail and admire the art-filled walls; it’s a veritable walk through memory lane for the bohemian set.This is a place where diners return for consistently well-prepared French-American cooking. The kitchen has a delicate touch, lifting standards like a rack of lamb with oyster mushrooms or octopus with chickpea purée above the everyday. Chilled corn soup with tender chunks of lobster and creamy avocado is a perfect summer opener, while plats principaux unites seared halibut with zucchini and wild garlic risotto with freshly shelled fava beans for a simple and delicious dish.
"
198,"Eastern Mediterranean cooking comes alive under the talented eye of Chef Ayesha Nurdjaja at this popular SoHo restaurant. Shuka's dining room buzzes with that quintessential downtown New York confidence. On balmy days, find those bright blue wood-framed doors swung open—of course.Start with the delicious whipped feta with pistachio and dill; a bright fattoush salad; or roasted Brussels sprouts tossed with yogurt, mint, pickled sultanas, and Urfa peppers. For dinner, go for the hen of the woods mushroom lahmajoun, a flatbread laced with labneh, thyme, confit garlic, and harissa; or savory shakshuka, which stars a skillet of spicy lamb meatballs and poached eggs simmering with tomato, chickpeas, Swiss chard, and currants.
"
199,"A series of successful pop-up dinners from Blue Hill at Stone Barns alum, Kevin Chen, inspired this stylish Asian-leaning tasting menu delight in the West Village. A glowing neon paperclip marks the glass-front façade; inside, the modern interior is left stark, clean, and simple in order to highlight the bright flavors of this cooking.The team's steadfast commitment to local farms is the cornerstone of this kitchen, and seasonal dishes showcases the young chef's Taiwanese heritage and Queens upbringing through a fine-dining lens. Think of tender, smoky short rib, paired with creamed brasicas and potato foam; tailed by elegant desserts, like a silky quenelle of dark chocolate mousse, dotted with whipped cream and miso caramel.
"
200,"Buzzy and beloved since day one, Chef Andrew Carmellini’s The Dutch quickly became a major hit and SoHo institution. Its primo corner windows open on to the sidewalk, tempting guests inside with a stocked oyster bar, cozy banquettes and sharply dressed service staff.The menu is just as seductive as the space, familiar but with fresh updates.Highlights include ""Chinatown Calamari,"" featuring deep-fried rings, golden and crispy, dressed with a salad of diced cucumber enhanced with fresh herbs and a spicy vinaigrette. Fresh pasta ravioli then arrives filled with subtly smoked ricotta set over a simple yet bright pomodoro sauce. Grilled snapper composed with avocado salsa and charred shishitos is best bolstered by a side of their excellent shoestring fries.
"
201,"Go ahead and pinch yourself—you’re not dreaming. Pinch Chinese is really that good. The décor, with red metal chairs and birch countertops, is straight-up SoHo, but the food is all Flushing. The glass-paneled kitchen with mask-wearing chefs can veer a bit lab-like, but don’t worry, as they’re busy making soup dumplings. These superlative gems are works of art that taste even better than they look. Pork soup dumplings are a bite-sized explosion of savory goodness, with fresh ginger, black vinegar and soy sauce; while perfectly crispy duck slices are served with wraps, hoisin, and cucumber for a deliciously classic rendition. Finish with simple vanilla ice cream.Happy Hour brings dumplings and wines (from a wonderfully surprising list) at a pretty price.
"
202,"Mad for Malaysian? Head to this lively dive, sequestered in a Chinatown arcade. Proffering some of the best Malaysian treats in town, including all the classics, this address sees a deluge of regulars who pour in for a massive offering of exceptional dishes. Round tables cram a room furnished with little more than a service counter. Still, the aromas wafting from flaky roti canai and melaka crispy coconut shrimp keep you focused on the food.Capturing the essence of this nation are brusque servers who speedily deliver abundant and authentic bowls of spicy-sour asam laksa fragrant with lemongrass; kangkung belacan, greens with dried shrimp and chili; and nasi lemak, the national treasure starring coconut rice, chicken curry and dried anchovies.
"
203,"For a truly memorable sushi adventure, head to this sleek and contemporary ten-seat counter—be forewarned though that dining in the back room does not guarantee the same experience. Chef Daisuke Nakazawa’s reputation is formidable, which works as a contrast to the jovial banter between the itamae from behind the counter. It simply elucidates the fact that this is a team who loves their craft and is happy to perform for their guests—perhaps using a live wriggling prawn for a bit of a spectacle.Discover flavorful and fatty cuts of fish available here at a more palatable price point compared to many of the city’s other notable sushi counters. Chef Nakazawa’s signature style combines supremely tender fish with perfectly seasoned rice, a spark of wasabi and judicious brush of nikiri for consistently excellent results.One night, for instance, may feature a spectrum of sushi from Hokkaido cherry salmon to live Massachusetts sea scallop with citrus and salt. Then move on to outstanding uni, and finally, a handroll of fatty tuna chopped so fine that it almost seems emulsified. Keep in mind that these chefs are always happy to adjust sizing based on each diner’s liking.
"
204,"When faced with the long, no-frills menu, there should be a caution sign to not miss out on the crab and pork soup dumplings. Its plump, juicy filling and flavorful broth held in each delicate wrapper with soy-ginger seasoning explains the afternoon crowd lunching out of takeout boxes at the entrance.Large bamboo steamer baskets line most tables, and the seared pan-fried pork dumplings are not to miss either. Cold appetizers also shine, like dark soy- and sugar-cooked bamboo shoots with wheat gluten, or thinly sliced stir-fried eel with chives. There are larger, steaming hot plates to choose from, like Shanghai rice cakes with beef. The “Eight Jewel Rice” dessert matches a mound of sticky rice with red bean paste, dates and golden raisin “jewels.”
"
205,"Manhattan has classic Italian and new Italian, but not many thoughtful Italian restaurants. Tuscany native Rita Sodi is out to change that with this ristorante. She consciously selected every aspect of the design, including the linen napkins to the thick, striated glass windows that hide the modern space from the marauding groups of youngsters on Christopher Street.Inside this oasis, Negronis prep palates for al dente rigatoni and hearty, meat-focused dishes like the coniglio in porchetta. This exceptional rabbit preparation combines bacon-wrapped loin with a sweet wine- rosemary- and garlic-sauce. The herbal quality of such savoriness brings out the almost austere nature of the lean rabbit, showing how truly intuitive and innovative Italian cooking can be.
"
206,"This polished, airy West Village charmer is a magnet for beautiful people. Or maybe it’s just that everyone looks gorgeous in L’Artusi’s romantically lit room, divvied up into three dining options and a quiet mezzanine, alongside its more traditional dining area. A semi-open kitchen, polished and gleaming with stainless steel, pushes out wickedly good Italian dishes like tender potato gnocchi in a rabbit cacciatore, laced with garlic, sweet tomato, rosemary and sage; or perfectly charred octopus paired with creamy potatoes, spiked with chilies, olives and savory pancetta.Polish that off with a drink from their generous list of aperitivi or fantastic selection of wines by the glass, and you’ll be feeling quite beautiful yourself by dinner’s end.
"
207,"For excellent pan-African cuisine, head to this beloved West Village service counter. There are only a handful of seats, but with colorful accent pillows and decorative baskets hanging on the walls, the mood is upbeat. Owner Diana Tandia hails from Mauritania, but her menu spans the Caribbean, Nigeria, and even France.Street food snacks and popular bowls layering the likes of richly spiced jerk chicken or berber beef over grains and vegetables are quick hits. But, if you’re seeking a dish to savor, order the four-hour roasted lamb. It’s worthy of a fine-dining operation and hints at Chef Tandia’s time at Per Se among other top kitchens.Just one dessert is made daily and sells out quickly. If it’s the decadent apple galette, get it before it’s gone.
"
208,"This modern and minimalist spot emanates with an impressive level of warmth. Beyond its entrance, find a few blonde-wood benches donning gray-blue pillows, and a U-shaped bar. Further back is the ever-immersive sushi counter, as well as a semi-private area with a large table. Temaki or hand rolls—don't miss the fantastic vegan options—are front-and-center, along with other items like a vegetable miso soup with fried tofu and shishito. Hungry diners will revel in the chef's set, which may uncover such delectable combos as salmon, onion cream, and tomato in toasted nori. Topped with scallions, chopped toro on wasabi rice is hard to resist; not unlike the broiled crab with spicy mayo that arrives in a nori shell studded with Rice Crispies for a delightfully inventive treat.
"
209,"Charming and proudly French, this self-proclaimed gastrothèque serves delicious Gallic plates to a svelte set. While carb addicts can barely fit into these wee seats, it’s worth the squeeze for Chef Jody Williams’ famously rustic cooking. Inside, everything comes alive with jazz and chatter. Instagrammable dishes take their cue from classics and may feature crusty olive oil-drizzled country bread slathered with fluffy scrambled eggs, salty prosciutto and nutty parmesan. Then await croissants—fresh, buttery and flaky—served with sweet fruit preserves for a typically French and very decadent treat.If not up the block at her other spot or in Paris or Tokyo, you may even find the chef herself holding meetings over a potent, frothy and flawless cappuccino.
"
210,"Situated just below street level, DOMODOMO is sleek and lovely, with carefully constructed wood furnishings and a long, smooth blonde wood counter. The buzz at the bar is magnetizing, and service is stellar with each sitting, as diners are presented with a small bowl of water and cleansing hand towel.Sushi is plentiful in New York, of course, but this kitchen ups the ante of their hand rolls with top-notch nori, rice and fish. Some combinations are familiar while others are quirky and inspired. It's not just about sushi here, though. Two crunchy, sweet chili sauce-glazed shrimp rest atop crisp Korean pear and peppery arugula dressed in a yuzu vinaigrette for a citrusy bite; while udon satisfies with its classically seasoned broth and tender noodles.
"
211,"It takes considerable skill to make design look so easy. This corner restaurant may tick all the zeitgeist boxes by sporting an ersatz-industrial look, complete with exposed brick, neat light fixtures and metal chairs, but it’s one that’s tempered by huge windows that let the sun pour in. Equally bright service keeps the atmosphere light and even the name is clever—“Gelso” being Italian for Mulberry, the cross street with Grand.The kitchen, too, is a cut above the norm. The homemade pastas are standouts, from brown butter gnocchi with braised lamb to lighter, if equally filling, choices like ricotta and spinach agnolotti. The wood-fired oven is used to good effect, especially with the pizzas, and flavors are as generous as the portions themselves.
"
212,"Authentic Jamaican flavors and thumping reggae go hand-in-hand amid Miss Lily’s bright orange booths, retro artifacts and Formica-topped tables. Wide-open windows overlooking buzzy Houston Street add to the allure. A well-stocked bar and bins filled with produce set the mood for enjoyable classics brought to you at the hands of glam servers.Start with jerk chicken that is insanely moist yet nearly black with intense spices, served with a Scotch bonnet sauce that will have your mouth tingling for hours. Then cool down with Melvin’s “body good” salad tossing kale, radish, celery and apples in a citrus-ginger vinaigrette. For the Jamaican Specialties—think curried goat, oxtail stew and callaloo—to a boozy rum cake, this Caribbean queen reigns supreme.
"
213,"Tomiño Taberna Gallega is a treasure trove of delicious tapas from Northwestern Spain, located here on the border of Little Italy and Chinatown. To call it a tavern may be a misnomer, as the dining room is attractively decorated with handsome wood tables, ocean-blue banquettes and a skylight overhead. Head to the roomy bar for a more typical perch from which to enjoy the great Spanish art of small-plate dining.The kitchen may offer some of the usual favorites, but the real emphasis is on Galician regional specialties. Start with croquetas, their golden shells rough and crumbly over a creamy béchamel filling studded with jamón or shellfish. Then move on to caldo Gallego—intensely flavored pork stew with collard greens and white beans.
"
214,"Nyonya flaunts a comfy setting composed of brick walls and basic wood tables, but really, everyone’s here for their outstanding Malaysian food. Speedy servers steer diners through the varied menu—and perhaps even away from such delicacies as prawn mee, an exceptionally spiced and sour shrimp broth with noodles, pork, vegetables and bean sprouts floating in its goodness.Asians and other locals know to stick to such faithful and deeply satisfying dishes as nasi lemak, which is a delightful combo of coconut rice, pickled veggies, crispy anchovies, curried chicken and hard-boiled egg. Mee siam spotlights noodles stir-fried with tofu and shrimp in a chili sauce that puts all other versions to shame, while coconut batter-fried jumbo prawns are nothing short of wow!
"
215,"Straddling a bright corner of the West Village, this lovely, light-filled destination allows the talented Chef Suzanne Cupps—formerly of Untitled at the Whitney—to connect with her diners in a more personal way. Find them basking in the soft warmth emanating from the enormous wood-burning hearth, tucking into bright salads, heady pastas, and vegetable-forward dishes.In fact, many of the ingredients that highlight Chef Cupp’s dishes are charred to sweet perfection in that very hearth. Try the Koginut squash, paired with black barley salad and creamy pepita mole; or the Moses Sleeper Lasagna, a deliciously gooey, cheesy adaption served with shredded kale salad. A scrumptious oatmeal pie, sporting whipped mascarpone, is the perfect cap to a divine meal. 
"
216,"The Loyal may be destined to become your new favorite American brasserie. This thoughtfully designed space is classy, comfortable and full of interesting art and tidbits; when full, the room’s energy is palpable.The menu is expansive, so there is bound to be something for everyone. Chef John Fraser does not strive to reinvent the wheel, but serves beautiful, upscale renditions of American items. Try crisp, cool radishes served over smoked trout gribiche with pearls of trout roe. Then sample house-made pici tossed in a creamy and umami-rich mushroom carbonara with bits of delicious guanciale. Classic desserts make it impossible to go wrong, whether you opt for the crowd-pleasing ice cream sundae or baked Alaska with Bourbon caramel.
"
217,"With only a few years on the downtown circuit, this chic charmer is already a bonafide Village sweetheart. Brought to you by the team behind the wildly popular Emporio and Aurora, the interior design of this restaurant features a long and welcoming bar; cozy, wood-lined banquettes; and a vibrant red-and-white mosaic floor.The kitchen doles out honest, unfussy Italian food rendered with a deft hand and keen attention to ingredients. Squid ink spaghetti is tossed with cubes of roasted swordfish, capers, black olives, a rustic chunky tomato sauce, and garnished with pistachios for a hearty plate. Bookend this with bundino served in a squat mason jar and starring caramel pudding with a cookie base as well as fresh whipped cream and chocolate wafer topping.
"
218,"Manhattan hot spots come and go (even more rapidly in the trendy Meatpacking District) but Pastis 2.0 is one watering hole that still glows anew. Keith McNally's impressively popular French bistro combines a painted tin ceiling, frosted globe lights, a curved zinc counter stocked with bottles of rosé on ice and precarious wooden stools to great effect.In case the decor didn't tip you off, the menu is classic French. It's open all day, so pop in for a croissant and coffee in the morning, then swing by to satiate that late-night frites craving. Everything from moules to steak is better with frites, but don't overlook the vegetables—asparagus in béarnaise sauce is dreamy. Traditional desserts, such as crème brûlée and baba au rhum, round out the meal perfectly. 
"
219,"Occasionally, predictability can be a beautiful thing, especially when it comes to rave-worthy Italian cooking. Via Carota is not so much robotically perfect as it is pleasing—in fact it’s the kind of place where dishes can (and should) be piled on. Italian style and artistry combine in this homey space that features bare wood farm tables, sideboards and whitewashed brick. A no-reservations policy means long waits that are actually worth it, so join those lines.Diners may start nibbling on deep-fried olives that are plump, piping-hot and stuffed with pork sausage. Then, a luscious (and unmissable) risotto cacio e pepe arrives loaded with pecorino and fresh pepper. For dessert, the simple-sounding flourless chocolate cake is downright excellent.
"
220,"It’s hard to walk by and avoid falling in love with this thoroughly charming Mediterranean favorite and its keen (if wandering) eye on Sephardic cuisine. Rebooted in a quaint new space, the open kitchen takes center stage in this bright and airy space.Golden brown crispy green olives are deliciously salty and rich, setting the meal off on the right path. Then, ceviche in a strawberry gazpacho broth is equal parts sweet and savory. Yellow cardamom pappardelle tossed with spring peas and curls of shaved feta is a fragrant, surprisingly light dish thanks to the green labne, but oh, those chocolate fingers. Imagine an upmarket Kit Kat with cornflake-crusted bottoms topped with Turkish coffee-laced ganache and you'll get the drift of this decadent dessert. 
"
221,"As ageless as its beautiful patrons, the brassy and mirrored Balthazar should be called “quintessentially SoHo” because it invented the term. One of the benchmark brasseries from serial restaurateur Keith McNally, the attractive space is housed in a former tannery. Those whiffs of leather have been replaced by red awnings, scents of pastries and an excellent oyster-filled raw bar completing its Parisian transformation.It seems as though every other table is topped with their bestselling steak frites or Le Balthazar, that towering seafood feast and signature since the late '90s. On the delicate side, sautéed skate is served with sweet raisins and tart capers; while silky beef tartare with shallots, herbs and Worcestershire spreads just like butter.
"
222,"If you forget about your bank statement, don’t arrive faint with hunger and leave your cynicism at the door—you’ll love ZZ’s Clam Bar. With just four marble tables and a small counter, this is as intimate as it gets. But you first have to navigate the bouncer at the door who’ll only allow admittance with a reservation. This at least ensures that, when you’re inside this bijou spot, the door doesn’t swing open every minute.Once in, you’re handed a cocktail list—these are, without doubt, some of the best in town and fully justify the lofty prices. The short seafood menu comes with a couple of choices under headings like “crudo,” “seared” and “ceviche.” Before you do anything else, order the trout roe on toast—it’s a beautiful thing and will linger long in the memory.This is not the place for everyone. Some won’t see past some of the more pretentious elements and affectations and the prices can be eye-watering—the Chianina beef carpaccio comes in at over $100. However, judicious ordering before you plunge into the cocktails, like having clams instead of caviar, can at least keep your final bill from escalating too wildly. It also helps that the place is run with considerable charm, patience and care.
"
223,"Chef Simone Tong, a native of Chengdu, brings her culinary flair to this contemporary Greenwich Village den. Pass through a set of hefty doors to arrive in a slim space, accoutered in warm wood, cushy banquettes, and textured walls. The menu reads like a narrative of Chinese immigrants craving a taste of home. In fact, nostalgia is at the forefront in grown-up versions of such staples as a chili crab Rangoon dip, served with crispy wontons and salted duck yolk. Scallion puffs are warm, wee-sized pastries matched with scallion butter; while fried rice laced with bok choy and deeply savory Larou is quite literally flipped on its head with a crisp crust on top.The wine list, flaunting natural and local producers, boasts of impressive range and value.
"
224,"Is there anything more lovely than a lazy lunch at Lupa? You’d be hard-pressed to convince the regulars otherwise, as they flock in droves to this Thompson Street treasure for its amicable service, interesting wines and otherworldly pasta.Carefully sourced products are scattered throughout this menu—witness perfectly seared octopus alla piastra, starring tender faro with crispy bits of prosciutto and fennel, or a starter of plump, marinated sardines laced with oil, coarse salt and served over diced cucumber and celery. But the highlight of this parade is the pasta, which may include decadent bavette cacio e pepe, a classic preparation from Lazio. It’s nothing short of satisfying, thanks to the addition of sharp pecorino and freshly ground black pepper.
"
225,"It’s not hard to find a lobster roll in this city, and for that we can thank Rebecca Charles. This seafood institution—inspired by Charles’ childhood summers spent in Maine—has been stuffing sweet lobster meat into split-top rolls since 1997. The two-room setting offers a choice: counter seating or table service. Wood furnishings and white walls are low-key; beachy memorabilia perks up the space.Start the meal by slurping your way through a classic chilled shellfish platter before tucking into that signature lobster roll, served alongside a tower of shoestring fries. The kitchen shines in daily specials, too, such as the grilled lobster served with corn pudding or pan-roasted wild bass. A hot fudge sundae is an appropriately nostalgic finish.
"
226,"With nostalgia at the forefront, Carbone is plain gorgeous. While this big and bold ode to Italian-Americana comes alive at dinnertime, lunch sees a crowd of crisp suits and Valentino-donning divas. A sense of history pervades the space, highlighting banquettes, ceramics, and chandeliers. Was the tiled-floor inspired by a certain scene in The Godfather? Indeed. Mid-century classics are what this menu is about, but exalted ingredients and presentations will excite even the most cynical. Servers work the floor cradling loaves of garlic bread with fresh mozzarella. Spaghetti alla gricia is a must; and chicken scarpariello is dolled-up with a chunky pepper- and mushroom-saucePrices are sky-high, but all is forgiven with the arrival of the six-layer blackout cake.
"
227,"The late, globally acclaimed chef, Joël Robuchon, returned his L'Atelier to the Big Apple, having traded in a former grand hotel for this fashionable address. The locale is the cherry on top for a fan base, who know just what to expect: ace food, steep prices, and the best pommes purée in town. The sultry space dons an ultra-modern design and pristine open kitchen. Centered around a cherry wood counter, the dining room draws inspiration from those convivial Spanish tapas bars.The cuisine is as luxurious as expected but the lavish ingredients aren't just accents here—they are stellar components of the many plates. The prix-fixe is an easy way to sample the breadth of the menu—from sea bass with fennel broth to spiced Long Island duck with young turnip.
"
228,"Following in the footsteps of its wildly popular Philadelphia elder, this lovely and entertaining corner gem also opened its doors to well-deserved acclaim. Set steps south of MePa, breakfast, lunch and dinner are all on offer here, with a focus on grains, sandwiches and wickedly good homemade breads.Outfitted with an open kitchen and small side counter to view the action, find delicious refinement in its simple cooking. A bright red gazpacho is topped with green herbs; while a roast beef sandwich is enhanced with horseradish and au jus. At dinner, the menu expands to heartier fare, like a bone-in pork loin or rainbow trout; even though the ultimate draw is the pastry team's baking program. Imagine cardamom sticky buns and smoked snickerdoodles.
"
229,"This snug charmer is a local favorite fit for the modern age. Expect blistered Neapolitan-style pizzas straight from the wood oven; excellent handmade pastas; and vegetable-focused small plates.While the city’s better Italian spots can usually be found outside Little Italy, this kitchen is working to change that impression. Reservations are hard to come by, so plan ahead. Plump diver scallops arrive seared to golden, sporting fennel slivers, crushed hazelnut and mandarin orange. Then look forward to al dente rigatoni tossed in a ricotta sauce dotted with pork sausage. For dessert, the seasonal option might feature lime curd topped with mascarpone ice cream, smoky meringue and hazelnut cookie crumble.
"
230,"Brought to you by Chef/owners Carlo and Michelle Pulixi, this Italian haunt has been known to stop passersby in their tracks. Fast-casual counters may dominate the culinary landscape today, but this homey and quaint osteria—laden with gleaming copper pots and rustic clay urns—aims to reflect the chef’s Sardinian roots.The menu is built around carefully sourced meats and products that are deftly prepared and presented. Try the tonnarelli con gamberi e pomodoro, a modest dish whose success rests solely on product quality and flavor balance. Braised artichokes are an evergreen favorite; while agnello (pistachio-crusted roasted lamb in a red wine sauce) is a delicacy and deservedly so. Well-priced wines and a handful of desserts make this spot a must stop.
"
231,"At first glance, Le Gigot transports guests to an inviting little family-owned bistro—the kind you’d only find in La Ville-Lumière. The service exceeds expectations with uncharacteristic warmth that brings a welcoming vibe to the nostalgic dining room.Tasty renditions of classic bistro fare dominate the menu, so expect the cooking to be familiar and pleasing. The petit bouillabaisse begins as a saffron fish broth with a red-peppery North African accent to elevate the traditional fish and seafood dish. Their cassoulet is a beloved Toulousaine version with duck confit, bacon, cannellini beans, herbs and luscious pork. Finally, brioche pudding conjures all that is simple and good in a dessert, with crème anglaise, berries and whipped cream.
"
232,"This West Village seafood shack is much more than just a destination for lobster rolls. Located on an irresistibly cute corner and outfitted with large windows, Mary’s Fish Camp tempts with creative daily specials. Scrawled on a chalkboard, these may include raw offerings and nostalgic desserts. Crowds pack into the stainless steel counter and fans spin lazily overhead.The summery space offers lots of choice, but the lobster roll should not be overlooked. A toasted bun is overflowing with hunks of tender, sweet meat dressed in the perfect proportion of mayonnaise and lemon juice, with a mountain of shoestring fries on the side. Begin your meal with the chowder on offer and end with a slice of Americana—or hot fudge Sundae with peanut brittle.
"
233,"While this circa 1937 watering hole has been restored, nothing here changes and that is its beauty. It is the quintessential New York City tavern and is still decked out with dark wood, checkerboard tiled floors, red banquettes and those caricature-lined walls. Like the throwback ambience, this menu reveres tradition and reads classic gastropub with dishes such as grilled oysters with pancetta in a Fresno chili butter; and Long Island duck breast finished with a classic Bigarade sauce. Pommes aligot, whipped into submission and loaded with garlic, butter and cheddar curds, is a crowd-pleaser, not unlike the bittersweet chocolate soufflé.The legendary burger is perhaps too-much-talked-about, though it manages to lure the crowds just the same.
"
234,"Brought to Mott Street, this charming spot from Chefs Ann Redding and Matt Danzer can be spotted from afar by its corrugated metal-and-wood façade. Inside, the design is just as you'd expect—mashed-up diner with Thai accents, like woven bamboo, rattan screens, and a counter with shiny wood seats. Behind is the kitchen that unlike the décor, exceeds all expectations. Look beyond the Americanized standbys and go for dishes with flavors that are fully realized. Classic-meets-comfort in the laab, featuring fried, not ground, chicken; or turkey- and mushroom-stuffed cabbage with a fragrant broth.Breakfast runs all day, so indulge in the Thai tea French toast; or for that matter, the beverage carte, which is yet another sample of this team's resourcefulness.
"
235,"The decadent cooking at The Beatrice Inn, which catapulted Chef Angie Mar to fame, is perfectly translated at her latest venture, which fittingly brings to life fine French cuisine in the form of fish and fowl. Diners should make their way into this mini, but mighty stunning space, accoutred with beautiful blue velvet banquettes, vintage chandeliers, and gilded mirrors. If that doesn't put you in a festive mood, get sipping on a thirst-quenching ""Francaise"" cocktail.What follows are a series of top-shelf plates, including cuisses de grenouille (frog’s legs with crispy artichoke hearts, all set in a wonderful Champagne-beurre blanc). Flaky crab pithiviers, filled with bay scallop frangipane and finished with an Oloroso sherry sauce, make an enticing <i>finis</i>.
"
236,"It's good news for those inquisitive diners always asking about recipes—it's all right in front of you at this LES hot spot. A well-orchestrated adaptation of classic Japanese shabu shabu, the cooks here literally “swish swish” a host of raw ingredients in pots of boiling water, before finishing them in sauces like sweet soy; pungent ponzu; and nutty miso.From melting slices of marbled Wagyu to slivers of pork belly wrapped around lettuce, everything gets seasoned, cooked, plated and garnished right at the ten-seat counter. At times, Spanish and Italian influences might make their way into this tasting menu, but the results are largely convincing. Diners should prepare to stay a while, as both the food and the hospitality deserve to be fully enjoyed.
"
237,"Japanese-Italian fusion is on the menu at this contemporary gem, displaying a myriad of colors and textures. While herringbone tile floors greet you upon entry, natural wood planks dominate the sunken dining room. A lofty ceiling looks down upon the bar area, marked by handsome square columns, a few tables and green settees. Your plate might unveil Asian ingredients cleverly weaved into classic Italian flavors—think of a rice cake lasagna with savory sausage, cabbage and tomato sauce. Small plates, like fried pizzette topped with shiso-sunflower pesto, squash shavings and chili oil, are ideal for sharing. Following their beverage program, desserts like Yakult soft-serve with roasted strawberries and chicken-skin streusel flaunt an equally inventive twist.
"
238,"Chef Ivy Stark has returned to her modern Mexican roots at this wonderful dining room set at the base of Nolita’s SoHotel. Exuding both an industrial-chic aura and Caribbean-lush demeanor, the space is focused around a stunning central wood sculpture and massive windows that showcase the lively bustle of Broome Street.The chef's passion for classical Mexican cuisine is evident in her meticulous mole and delicate tortillas, as well as more original creations including molotes—here, these crispy masa shells are filled with creamy, cilantro-flecked crab. Taco fillings are consistently delicious—from shatteringly crisp squash-blossom tempura to savory carnitas. And while it may not be traditional, “Tia Frida’s” warm and gooey chocolate cake is sheer bliss.
"
239,"Push through this classic SoHo street, dotted with boutiques and coffee shops, and head straight into Rubirosa's narrow, dimly lit dining room simply to discover how very cool pizza can be. Although it's loud and may be cramped with the requisite 80s tunes blaring overhead, this adept Italian-American kitchen is bright with classic dishes and an heirloom pizza recipe from Joe and Pat's on Staten Island that’s 57-years-old and counting.This classic pie balances a crisp, cracker-thin crust with tart tomato sauce and oven-melting mozzarella. And the handmade pastas are highly recommended—you can’t go wrong with a bowl of chittara and hefty meatballs. Half portions allow diners to enjoy more of this cooking; gluten-free options ensure everyone can enjoy it.
"
240,"This enticing Indonesian restaurant, brought to you by Chef/co-owner Cédric Vongerichten boasts a modern French flair. Located in ever-fashionable SoHo, the long and sleek restaurant is a riot for the senses, thanks to a lush, exotic décor filled with candles, pillows, live plants, and warm teak paneling.The seasonal menu is divided into satays, sides, small and large plates, as well as a sprinkling of desserts. A tender, meaty Peekytoe crab cake arrives complete with notes of fenugreek, tamarind, and paired with a thatch of fresh micro herbs plus gently pickled cucumbers. Succulent pork ribs—glazed in soy tamarind with a flutter of sesame seeds and served with a refreshing tamarind-chili vinegar—is particularly satisfying.
"
241,"The petite space is serene and showcases a particularly pleasing mix of blonde wood and exposed brick, decorated with little more than birch branches.Begin with a plump Kumamoto oyster with slightly sweet ponzu sauce and lime zest in the company of sashimi. Their nigiri—with bright flavors and skilled torch work—is sure to be the highlight of your meal thanks to halibut with lemon and sea salt, belt fish with wasabi, and shima aji with yuzu juice. Each slice of fish drapes off the delicate shari, but the application of sauces can be heavy handed at times. Generous proportions belie Zo’s origins as a sushi-ya unafraid to flout tradition. Finish with a blue crab handroll, richly satisfying red miso soup and a scoop of hojicha ice cream.
"
242,"It gets shoulder-to-shoulder at this tiny and mighty popular restaurant, with its vibrant canary-yellow booths, mosaic tiles and cozy wood paneling. Owner Nialls Fallon and Chef Nick Perkins also own the acclaimed Bed-Stuy hot spot, Hart, but here at Cervo’s, they take a crack at the coastal flavors of Spain and Portugal, with an inventive, seafood-centric menu.The staff is welcoming and well-informed on how to pair the brilliant Spanish wine list with the Med-inflected fare, including flaky squid empanadas, plump with inky filling; or savory Serrano ham paired with tender butter beans and Meyer lemon. Don’t miss the mussels escabeche, floating in an irresistible olive oil-drizzled broth, perfect for dragging the house-made sourdough bread through.
"
243,"Like its UES elder, this little den is helmed by Chef Junichi Matsuzaki of the Ash Room. In Japanese tradition, savory small plates called otsumami may be offered along with alcoholic beverages. These bites tend to be anything but small, however, and following suit, the chef's precise, seasonally driven omakase offers an array of robust otsumami, nigiri and sashimi. Rather than appetizers followed by nigiri, these creations are woven together in deliciously inventive ways, arriving first as say, sashimi, and then repurposed a few courses later as nigiri.All of this transpires in a wee space donning a blonde matte wood counter made from Japanese cyprus and framed by seven seats. The spartan design is far from novel, but it is elegant and very inviting. 
"
244,"Art and food collide at this charming restaurant courtesy of the talented Vincent Chirico, whose food teems with depth, flavor and ingenuity. This team showcase their formidable culinary talent alongside the incredible artwork of Amon Focus and Noëmi Manser.The menu concept is a tasting and diners can choose from areas labeled Raw, Garden, Sea, and Land—or leave it entirely to the chef's discretion as he hand-delivers each plate from the semi-open kitchen into the fun, chichi room. Seafood is a particular strength here, so a night in his capable hands might unveil wildly fresh Long Island fluke with Fuji apple, coriander and fennel. Also try luscious hamachi, artistically plated with avocado, Fresno chili and a cool, clear ginger-kissed consommé.
"
245,"Knowing when to leave something alone, whether you’re a painter, singer or cook, requires confidence in your material and your own ability. Here at Blue Hill, Dan Barber’s kitchen displays its utter trust in the products at hand not only by not interfering with them too much but also giving them space in which their natural flavors can shine.This intimate, sophisticated space is as popular as ever and the team clearly shares the chef's passion and pride. The “farm to fork” mantra may be something of a cliché today, but this chef demonstrates that the startlingly obvious equation of great seasonal ingredients equals great food remains the cornerstone of every serious restaurant. A majority of ingredients come from Stone Barns Center in Westchester County and the eponymous farm in Massachusetts.Diners decide between a six-course “Farmer’s Feast” tasting or a four-course “Daily Menu."" Dishes are described in refreshingly terse terms to reflect the relative simplicity of what’s on the plate, whether that’s parsnip grits with a jammy egg yolk or Montauk black bass with dill purée. Food waste is even transformed into treasure here, as in the juice pulp burger with crisp polenta fries.
"
246,"It's no surprise that this charming osteria is still prospering in the hands of talented Chef Marc Forgione, who took over from longtime legend, Frank DeCarlo. And except for the pasta, everything here is cooked in the fiery hearth that is the very centerpiece of Peasant. The décor is appealingly rustic, thanks to whitewashed walls, bare wood tables, and a bustling wine bar.These dishes are upscale interpretations of traditional Southern Italian fare, as evidenced by ""pizza"" dough crowned with thin slices of rotisserie porchetta arrosto, redolent of garlic and rosemary. Rigatoni mezzi-arrabiata is a delicious mashup of basil, breadcrumbs, and a wonderfully herbaceous tomato sauce; while pumpkin-spiced panna cotta certifies nothing short of sweet dreams.
"
247,"The buzz surrounding Nasim Alikhani’s pretty Park Slope spot is deservedly strong. The Chef/owner immigrated to NY from Iran over 35 years ago, making her way through many a kitchen before landing her own iteration. It was well worth the wait, for at Sofreh, she has managed to pin Persian cuisine firmly onto the ground. The decor displays no splashes of color, just calm inspiration all around. A bright marble bar welcomes all to her glass-clinking retreat, with high-ceilings and black wood beams.Thanks to this minimalist aspect, the colorful food is able to shine through. Dinner might reveal beef meatballs simmered with sour cherries and set beside string fries, or succulent lamb in a turmeric-and-onion consommé, tucked with fava beans and crisp onions.
"
248,"This local sure has that sunny south-of-the-border disposition with its tiled walls, wood booths, and turquoise chairs, but there’s nothing typical about it. In fact, there’s nary an oozing quesadilla in sight, since this kitchen is completely vegan. What you will find though is such winning dishes as beet and pumpkin empanadas with a flavorful chimichurri and chile de arbol for additional ka-pow. The chorizo tacos, which sub seitan for spicy pork sausage, are wrapped inside turmeric tortillas and—even better—dipped in a fiery salsa. Then, chile rellenos—stuffed with corn, coconut cheese, squash, and spinach—are equal parts sweet and savory, thereby sealing their reputation as a surefire yet virtuous hit.A Brooklyn branch keeps borough dwellers sated.
"
249,"First things first, The Flower Shop is more about Moscow Mules than mums, but judging by the packed vibe, that’s just fine. Besides, the crowd is here to soak up the scene, which is a a little bit 70’s nostalgic and a whole lot of fun. Most come for the drinks, but stay for the food as diners are usually treated to some delicious grub.This menu churned out of this kitchen may be best described as gastropub-gone-global with eclectic offerings ranging from meat pies to Brussels sprouts with Sichuan peppers. A juicy, fried chicken sandwich slathered with spicy mayo or any one of the cheeseburgers (including a Beyond Burger) promises to balance out your cocktails for the night, but go for the fish and chips if you want to stick to the specialized pub theme.
"
250,"This darling of a dining room is designed with elegant blue-grey leather banquettes, black lacquer bentwood chairs, and a dark checkerboard floor. Potted plants, moody lighting, and a rustic bar with brass accents make it a dream-worthy refuge for a romantic tête-à-tête. Married couple, Angie Rito and Scott Tacinelli, are the brains behind this venture, where the team takes risks that result in highly creative and enriching cuisine.While the menu feels like an American story as told through an Italian lens, Asian elements also make guest appearances as in the spicy pepperoni fried rice gussied-up with tender grilled calamari. Playful aptly describes the combination of spicy veal tartare and tuna carpaccio. Pastas are similarly prolific, like the paprika-tinted sopressin with smoked mussels or sourdough pasta in a 'Nduja sauce with mezcal-braised chicken. Pesce alla griglia in a clam broth and Sicilian scallop crudo speak of bold flavors and polished methods.Desserts, such as the fior di latte mochi with golden Taggiasca olive oil or black cocoa tiramisu garnished with feuilletine, are just the icing on the cake. Go for over-the-top glee with a sip of house-made root beer amaro.
"
251,"This quintessential Greenwich village spot lives on as a flourishing destination for visitors and locals alike. Housed along a charming block, the exterior too is a draw and has remained the same since its inception in 1998.Chef Fortunato Nicotra helms the stoves and delivers winning dishes, like citrus and fennel-dusted sweetbreads with Jerusalem artichokes. Pastas are, per usual, a priority and include the rustic beef cheek ravioli filled with squab liver; or the full-throttle garganelli tossed with wild mushrooms and black truffles. This is food with a palpable sense of simplicity. For validation, look to the grilled lamb chops paired with broccoli rabe pesto and grilled onions. You're likely to be too full for dessert, so finish with a sip of amaro.
"
252,"Brendan Sodikoff's destination makes the case that NY should be home to more Chicago influencers. This spot may be named for its street address, but the intimate size and modest exterior make it a charming hideaway. The staff merely enhance this special vibe, by ensuring the comfort of each diner with engaging banter.Some dishes may break with tradition, but offer nothing short of tasty results. Additionally, the menu showcases a sense of depth by going beyond the eponymous dish, which is coincidentally served in three different ways. Others are firmly footed classics, served alongside creamed spinach, roasted garlic, and butter-laden mashed potatoes. Bookend your meal with cocktails and a wedge of Valrhona dark chocolate pie in an Oreo-cookie crust.
"
253,"Having dispensed with its previous incarnation, this attractive spot has remerged as a sleek and upscale restaurant. Fausto serves consistently delicious Italian-influenced food courtesy of Chef/owner Erin Shambura, but its overall ethos is guided by restaurateur (and sommelier), Joe Campanale.The kitchen showcases a distinctive take on Southern regional fare that ensures each bowl of pasta is a showstopper. Find evidence in the whole wheat bigoli al torchio, twirled with duck ragù and Piave Vecchio. Regardless of what you eat, save room for the roasted heirloom vegetables set atop goat cheese with pistachios and a drizzle of honey. Forge ahead with impressive fish and seafood items, before closing out with a superb cheese course in lieu of dessert.
"
254,"Housed on the second floor of a nondescript low-rise, this long, deep and boisterous little SoHo alcove is as downtown New York as ever. It's also an ideal place to convene with friends over exquisite nibbles and quenching cocktails; and regardless of how loud it gets, there is an infectious, omniscient spirit that encourages diners to linger.Maybe that’s because the talented chef behind this operation, Ignacio Mattos, is unfaltering and impressively consistent in his creative renditions of such bold and iconic dishes as ricotta dumplings with mushrooms and Pecorino Sardo. The menu goes on to offer an array of shareable plates that changes regularly, but if you spot that delightful risotto special, jump on it and worry about the calories later.Dinner might kick off with perfect, sashimi-grade tuna accompanied by woodsy black trumpet mushrooms and elevated by a smooth and tart mirin-soy sauce. Your meal may then hit a crescendo, thanks to dramatically plated fried arroz negro scattered with tender squid and hazelnut-studded romesco. A soft and custard-y panna cotta decked out with vinegar, honey and smoked sea salt brings this enticing series of events to an exalted end. 
"
255,"It’s a delight just to enter this beautiful, sun-filled neighborhood dining room. The plant-filled space is furnished with ethically sourced American oak tables and a wall of banquettes; the bar is perfect for solo dining. And all this charm awaits you even before you sink your teeth into the ultra-delicious food. The contemporary, product-driven, and Mediterranean-inspired menu focuses on local sourcing, and includes such appealingly simple creations as a vibrant, creamy yellow tomato soup, finished with cucumber relish, red onion, and an oil drizzle.Breakfast is big and served during the week, while weekends offer a full brunch menu, featuring the likes of a piping-hot composition of huevos with black beans, cheese, tortilla crisps and crema.
"
256,"This gem flies a little under the radar, but Chef Franco Sampogna and team have serious resumes. Its a tasting menu-only spot that doubles as a gallery; in fact, even the entrance is as artistic as the canvases lining its walls. There are just 18 counter seats and a table for six, but the size only adds to its exclusivity. Watch as the crew plate contemporary French dishes, with keen eye towards texture. A tartlet of tomatoes with Ibérico ham is an eye-opening start; while global flavors are brought to life in a daring combination of prawns buried under ikura and cilantro.Bringing it back to the flavors of his native Brazil, the chef may then reveal a dessert of caramel and dulce de leche ice cream with toasted hazelnuts for exquisite taste and crunch.
"
257,"It would be a mistake to write-off this groovy spot as just another hotel restaurant, as it is in fact a fully formed dining room that simply happens to be in a hotel. Though the menu is unassuming—a few vegetable-forward appetizers, pastas, and proteins—the Mediterranean and Asian influences that inform the cooking are nothing short of delicious. Casual servers deliver confidently prepared winners, like grilled maitake with ramp purée, whipped ricotta, and fried bread. Toothsome pastas like spaghetti nero with crab, and bigger plates like lamb shank embossed in a smoky pomegranate glaze and showered with fresh mint and red onions are fit for sharing.The long bar casts a sepia-tone over the retro furnishings and makes a great perch for a sip or several.
"
258,"This unassuming Houston St. standard is an unsung hero, even if many walk past Emilio’s gold- and red-etched window and write it off as some run-of-the-mill red-sauce joint. Step inside the narrow, weathered space, where owner Emilio Vitolo and son, Anthony, offer each guest a personal welcome and a genuine Italian-American experience.The menu is filled with pasta classics like Roman cacio e pepe, tossed with sharp pecorino and freshly ground black pepper. Signature specialties include pollo Emilio, a delicately breaded chicken cutlet draped in lemon-caper sauce; and clams oreganata speckled with garlicky breadcrumbs. Crisp cannoli shells filled with vanilla- and cinnamon-tinged ricotta cream rival any other version found from Palermo to Siracusa.
"
259,"Chef Yoshihiko Kousaka is in control of this beloved sushiya, which offers a stellar omakase in an elegant setting. The dining room flaunts a classic Japanese sensibility—outfitted with a counter for 12, a few tables, soft piano music, as well as an attentive staff that enhance the overall experience.Some counters like to keep everyone in sync, but Chef Kousaka is more flexible. It is certainly a rigorous balancing act, but he moves with confidence and skill. Fish is minimally embellished, relying instead on original sourcing and impeccable technique. Highlights include everything from red snapper and Japanese sea bass to wild winter yellowtail and firefly squid. Supplemental items, like king crab and ankimo, are also available and can augment your meal.
"
260,"We all know that vegetables are good for us, but Dirt Candy shows us how good they can also taste. Chef Amanda Cohen’s menu never hides the fact that you’re eating vegetarian (and vegan) cuisine, but with her ethical approach and haute techniques, these simple-seeming eats are transformed into artistic bites. Broccoli hot dogs, topped with a warm broccoli kraut and a Carolina mustard sauce, are flavorful and fun, while the carrot slider is as tender and satisfying as a Big Mac. The vegetables aren’t just for dinner either—they also star in desserts like the triple-layer cauliflower cake with white icing, dots of caramel, and a small scoop of caramel ice cream.The tasting menu ensures that you’ll be able to sample a wide variety with five or nine courses.
"
261,"If in the mood for cocktails, head to the second floor of this townhouse, where Bar Fortuna entices with a stirring selection. Then dinner awaits at Casa Apicii—run by the who’s who of NY dining. The main room is loud, but let’s just call it “lively” since everyone here seems to be having a good time. An alabaster fireplace, starburst chandeliers and leather seats fashion a mien so welcoming that it almost lets you forget about the errors in service.Warm, crisp focaccia, dotted with Champagne grapes and fennel pollen, arrives with olive oil and truffle honey for a pleasing contrast of sweet and savory. Other highlights, like a crudo of scallops enriched by bright pink prickly pear juice, chervil and pearls of caviar is almost too pretty to eat—almost.
"
262,"This romantic retreat, housed in an historic Brooklyn enclave, is notalgia embodied—as if it’s been a corner fixture for some hundred years. It hasn’t, of course, but decorative design details like silver bowls filled with bright citrus, a pressed-tin ceiling, and tufted leather banquettes impart that sophisticated, old-school vibe.Chef/co-owner Bryan Calvert sources most of the herbs—that are featured on your plate—from the rooftop garden. His dishes may wander from an immeasurably gratifying chicken and turmeric brodo with edible micro flowers, to an herbaceous and distinctly Californian ensemble of asparagus, shaved radish, and lemon ricotta. For an appealingly contemporary resolution, go for the rye chocolate cake with elderberry-blueberry coulis.
"
263,"The smell of fresh-baked focaccia wafting through the dining room is a comforting constant at this pasta haven. From the kitchen, servers ferry out warm slices as guests are seated, and after the first bite, it’s clear that nobody will be leaving. Every one of the pastas is made in-house, and shapes like maccheroni, spaghetti, rigatoni, and agnolotti lean on Roman preparations—like white pork ragù, carbonara, and amatriciana. An obvious starter is the suppli, a fried ball of risotto stuffed with mozzarella di bufala and set on a rich cacio e pepe-style sauce.Overall, these hearty dishes are best split between two in a space that's quaint and worthy of a date. House-made gelato or, if you’re lucky, a slice of honey cake will round out the evening.
"
264,"Named after the Bronx street that his father grew up on, Loring Place is where Chef Dan Kluger serves up delicious, stylistic, and locally sourced Californian cuisine to a downtown crowd. And yet, none of this comes as a surprise as the chef has showcased his talents for years and been the recipient of much acclaim in the city. His skillfully made, vegetable-centric American fare served here is unique and spirited, beginning with caramelized cauliflower served with chilies and Meyer lemon jam. Market-driven salads dominate the lunch menu, while the wood-oven pizzas, made with house-milled whole wheat flour, are a hit at any time.The generously sized room is uncluttered and mid-century chic, with bright orange window frames and boldly striped banquettes.
"
265,"This longtime congee haunt will forever be what it is—a reliable source for creamy, bubbling-hot rice porridge flecked with everything from little strands of ginger and blue crab to abalone, that rarest of species. This has been the restaurant’s signature since it opened in 1996, and one senses that the dark interior probably hasn’t been renovated since. But, nobody is here for the décor; it's the menu that's the sole draw.Finding the nearly 30 varieties of this soothing eponymous soup means flipping through a massive menu, past pictures of sizzling beef and giant crabs, to reach the back page. Beyond congee, go simple with dunkable sticks of puffy, deep-fried crullers for a satisfying contrast in texture, or sautéed snow pea leaves with minced garlic.
"
266,"This sibling to Torishiki in Tokyo arrives to NY by way of NoHo. Blacked-out windows mark its entrance; diners are then buzzed in at street level, all of which add to the mysterious proceedings. A staff member then pulls back a curtain—et voila—you're here. Inside, Chef/owner Yoshiteru Ikegawa may be found working his skills like a master pianist—turning, fanning, saucing, and brushing. It's a pristine workspace and the menu is a tribute to the yakitori tradition. Binchotan charcoal plays as vital a role as the fowl itself, with the aroma becoming one with the space and skewer.Chilled kombu-poached chicken is a succulent first bite. Vegetables, too, get their due—as in charred cipollini onion, or agedashi tofu starring tapioca starch in lieu of potato.

267,"If you peered through the window of this little neighborhood nook, you might think it's just a simple wine bar. But much to the surprise of walk-ins trying to score a glass or two after work, reservations are absolutely required here. And, instead of simple charcuterie plates or standard cheese boards, the kitchen team offers a concise tasting menu that is seasonally driven, and ergo, changes with remarkable frequency. A first bite might feature house-made potato chips dusted with green onion powder and served with sour cream. Bolder items include asparagus with pistachio purée and egg yolk, or monkfish with a buttery Grenada-pepper sauce.The wine list leans heavily on small producers—many of them organic or biodynamic from Italy and France.
"
268,"Chef Zod Aridai's tenet of clean, unmasked cooking comes to life at this correspondingly simple albeit stunning spot. White textured walls are an ideal canvas for mounted brass light fixtures; the front room features a vibrant banquette and purple chairs, while a bar and series of tables reside in the second section. Contemporary, New American small plates with a view to seasonality is on the menu. Gently cooked salmon is a rich dish, thanks to a ginger-lime broth, diced daikon and red grapes. Roasted pumpkin with bits of walnut fudge and fresh cranberries is then finished with candy-caramel tuiles and pumpkin foam for a well-balanced treat.The check, if it arrives in a Black Sabbath CD case, is in keeping with the global-meets-moody soundtrack of beats.
"
269,"Chef/owner Melanie Shurka traveled to Israel to learn the art of making kubeh (dumplings) from the immigrant women of Kurdish, Iranian and Syrian descent. Taste the results of her education in this lovely respite, which showcases fresh, wholesome food, including a heartfelt rendition of its namesake dish. Though hand-rolled kubeh may be prevalent in the Middle East, they can be hard to find here. Don’t miss the Syrian lamb version, filled with richly spiced meat served in a hamusta broth with chard and zucchini. Round out your meal with tahini-drizzled roasted eggplant, although the baklava will make it a challenge to truly call it quits.The cuisine may be ancient, but the setting is clean and contemporary, with old-world heirlooms decorating the walls.
"
270,"This local standout is situated in a waterfront neighborhood that feels not only charming but utterly untouched by time. The original carriage house was a butcher shop before becoming Vinegar Hill House—a lineage that seems apropos of such steady and perfectly delicious cooking.From the kitchen, diners may expect such rustic and enchanting items as creamy goat’s blue cheese with house-made crackers, honey and plum jam. Then dig into a roasted half chicken with copious jus and splash of snappy sherry vinegar served in a cast-iron skillet. Delicately crafted gnocchi with a silky lemon sauce and bright green arugula are light in texture; while the dark, impossibly moist chocolate Guinness cake is outrageously rich, thanks to its cream cheese frosting.
"
271,"From white-jacketed servers to that pristine counter, this updated yet model LES café channels the very spirit and charm of its mothership, set only blocks away. The adept kitchen follows suit, taking the original, appetizing classics and turning them on their heads to form an array of proper and profoundly flavorful dishes.Regulars perch at the bar to watch the ‘tender whip up a cocktail or classic egg cream, while serious diners find a seat and get noshing on hot- and cold-smoked Scottish salmon teamed with everything-bagel chips. The result? A thrilling contrast in flavor and texture. Caramelized chocolate babka French toast is crowned with strawberries for a sweet-savory treat; and “eggs Benny” with salmon, spinach and challah never fails to peg a bruncher.
"
272,"Georgian cuisine centered around meats, cheese and bread is what this bright and modern spot is about. Enter to discover a colorfully scribbled chalkboard as well as a metal-topped bar adorned with Moorish tiles. Lofty ceilings, white walls and natural wood floors add to the stark and clean feel—not unlike its appealingly unfussy cuisine. Servers move about with a sense of purpose, steering diners through such classics as housemade dumplings filled with goat cheese and feta or pork and beef. Delicious simplicity shines through in the rich and cheesy puff pastry; while the ""Butchers Special""—a beef-and-pork kebab—is coupled with green chili sauce and pomegranate seeds for a dash of fun and flair.Oenophiles will thrill to the Georgian-focused wine list.
"
273,"Ko has been the pride and joy of David Chang's culinary empire. Open since 2014 and tucked into an East Village alley, it begins a new chapter under the stewardship of Chef Esther Ha. Some things remain unchanged, like the upbeat soundtrack, sleek counter staged around a kitchen with nowhere to hide, and a vibe so relaxed that diners might even sing along.Favored dishes, like the chickpea hozon with sea urchin, are still here and still excellent. Chef Ha though carries the torch forward, bringing new ideas to the fore—aged strip loin with onion béarnaise and aged cheddar is a cheeky twist on the cheeseburger. Smoked onion soufflé is exemplary, while bonito ice cream with sweet potato skins reflects a bold brand of cooking—a cornerstone of this kitchen.
"
274,"Olmsted hasn’t lost any of its luster, with Brooklynites continuing to pack its ever-hip and happening space. Reservations are a challenge, but those lucky enough to nab a seat are treated to Chef Greg Baxtrom’s concise and thoughtfully conceived menu of starters and entrées.Forget farm to table; this kitchen is backyard to table thanks to a blooming and expanded vegetable and herb garden.Creativity is abundant, as seen in snap pea sushi, which subs out rice for raw peas; and lobster thermidor with meaty crackers alongside a frothy lobster-Gruyère dip. While the carte changes often, a few constants remain, like the Thai green papaya salad tweaked with shaved asparagus, or a carrot crêpe draped over clams and plated on an orange dish—natch.
"
275,"Minimal, industrial and in harmony with the cool neighborhood, this is the kind of classic downtown spot that draws trendy millennials from afar. Seating is either intimate or cramped, and the music is lively or loud, all depending on your mood. Enthusiastic servers add to the room’s energy.Offering eight courses (a cheese option is extra) for just under $100, their prix-fixe is renowned not just for its ambition but also for value. While the menu format may be fixed, dishes change frequently to reflect the young chefs’ wide-ranging talents and contemporary flair. This kitchen really plays it up, presenting textures and ingredients in unusual, but appealing ways. Case in point? The skate, perfectly creamy and set over a surprisingly savory and tart sauce of pickled blueberries, green olives and parsley. The heartbreakingly tender Wagyu topped with chamomile-flavored butter alongside porcini-stuffed cabbage is another winner. Dessert is serious here, as seen in the Meyer lemon, cashew, sweet milk parfait.It's likely you won't recognize any names on the wine list, hyper-focused on natural winemakers. Sip from a similar list and nibble on signature snacks next door at sibling Wildair.
"
276,"Excellent yakitori, thirst-quenching cocktails, and a welcoming vibe—what’s not to love at Chef Greg Baxtrom’s relaxed haunt? This small and  slender space boasts a bright brasserie vibe, thanks to primary colors, lively beats, and vintage globe lights. Over in the kitchen, izakaya staples are spun with the chef's classically trained French technique. With every dish offered, there’s a lot to sample—and sample you should.Skewers rule the roost, alongside a host of classical sauces and hearty baguettes with yuzu kosho butter. Dinner might unveil pickled veggies—even legumes—followed by duck rilletes with wasabi foam, wasabi hollandaise, and pickled ginger; or escargot topped with crispy panko. A slice of Japanese cheesecake is the cherry on top.
"
277,"Chef Mark Garcia may have launched a myriad spots, but Kissaki is especially favored due to its simple, inviting setting, sushi counter, smattering of seats, and gray-painted walls. A midnight-blue, tan and gray motif drives home the clean design aesthetic. Correspondingly, the omakase is markedly more unique and even if one takes those lavish garnishes away, the diner is left with impeccably cooked shari rice mingled with pristine fish.Begin with a hearty grilled cheese (toasted brioche packed with a burrata-ricotta mix and Santa Barbara uni). From there, tread into lighter bites, like soy-brushed blue fin tuna or shima aji with black garlic purée. Grapefruit-campari sorbet with baby kiwi proves that this food is about elegant and peak flavors.
"
278,"This delightful restaurant delivers contemporary Indian cuisine that brings a refined touch to familiar South Asian plates. All thanks are due to Chef Sujan Sarkar, who landed in NY fresh from his success in San Francisco. Baar Baar may bill itself as a gastropub, but dining is the focus here. In fact, its vast, inventive menu is filled with such delicious condiments, as if to prove that no detail is too small for this kitchen. Try a plate of paneer chili, where cubes of fresh cheese and a spiced tomato achar are wrapped inside crisp kataifi shreds and served with ginger chutney. Other highlights include lamb keema or Brussels sprouts foogath.The large, industrial space can feel cold, but warm, jeweled tones and even warmer service make up the difference.
"
279,"Chef Sal Lamboglia and Chef/owner Andrew Carmellini clearly know what they wanted to do in this kitchen: make excellent Italian (and Italian-American) food with a delicious twist here and surprise ingredient there. The result is a restaurant we would all want to have just around the corner. Great wine, a friendly service team and two floors of comfortable seating make it easy for guests to pile in, night after night.Start with meatballs, a far cry from the generic kind, stuffed with Fontina and braised until tender in a chunky tomato sugo. Pasta here rivals Italy, especially the spaghetti with small, briny clams and spicy ‘njuda crumbles topped with breadcrumbs and parsley. Daily specials are also a delight, as is the simply delicious hazelnut gelato.
"
280,"This is the kind of cooking and scene that makes you wish you were Italian. Start with a stroll through the alimentari up front to grab some goodies; then settle into the rustic and warm dining area in the back. Note the meticulous copper roof and open kitchen, which set a picturesque backdrop for a delicious meal.Confident and tasty aptly describe this all-day carte. Technically a white pizza, the green zebra tomato pie spotlights a wood-fired oven crust topped with pickled green tomato and a medley of mozzarella, provolone, stracciatella, and feta. Perfectly chewy spaghetti, tossed with lemon zest, bottarga di mugggine and red pepper flakes, is simple yet wholly devourable. Silken panna cotta then gets a glug of top-notch balsamic for a memorable finish.
"
281,"This rousing Indian restaurant in Essex Market is refreshingly unapologetic with its complex spices, fierce heat levels and inspired preparations of more unusual items (kidneys, anyone?). Dhamaka, which means “explosion” in Hindi, is a bold love letter to the country’s more rustic dishes, many of which are drawn from the owner’s childhood. Where else have you had smoky goat belly flecked with coriander seeds and wrapped in cedar wood? How often does your mutton come in a clay pot filled with a deliciously dark chili oil and an entire bulb of roasted garlic? The kitchen grinds many of its spices daily, and the crowds have been quick to recognize such attention to detail. Tables are comically small but bring friends anyway.
"
282,"This Prospect Heights haven is one that should be on everyone's radar. Adorned with cool marble surfaces and a flaming open kitchen, it is welcoming, intimate, and tranquil. The long bar is lovely for socializing, as is the backyard—which flaunts the kind of charm that diners crave on warm days.Thanks to this kitchen's vision, the menu is concise and dotted with superb items. Start with the fresh-baked focaccia—a veritable dream among carb lovers—that pairs especially well with creamy chicken liver mousse and tangy pickles. Then proceed to devour the wonderfully gamey Colorado lamb chops, tailed by a peach and blueberry tart with vanilla gelato. From a palatably priced flight of amari to the house soda, this team offers an ideal dining experience.
"
283,"It’s all too easy to find favor in this bustling Basque getaway, located at the foot of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. Sleek coffee-brown tables, globe light fixtures dangling throughout, and a long, marble-top bar exude midcentury-modern style, while a constant crowd fosters a near electric vibe. Indeed, everything is meant to be shared, and everyone is having a good time.A mound of house-made potato chips layered with thin slices of jamón Ibérico is a fitting start, before piling the table with heartier dishes like meltingly tender tripe slow-braised with tomatoes and morcilla. Then linger over an equally rich grilled squad breast served with rice and mushrooms. The wine list is an impressive tomb of small organic and biodynamic Spanish producers.
"
284,"With its selection of creative shared plates, aRoqa ensures that contemporary Indian food is now easier to find. Courtesy of the talented team behind Moti Mahal Delux, the aura here is more romantic than family-friendly, featuring moody tones of black and gold, an arched dark wood ceiling, and a bar with shimmering panels.Elaborate menu descriptions seem to promise the world, but deliver dishes that are more familiar and Indian at heart, finished with creative flair. Thoroughly enjoyable starters include a plate of smoked eggplant served with fenugreek-spiced paratha.. Then indulge in khade tamatar ka murgh, offered as bone-in drumsticks in a rich, sweet, and spicy tomato-butter curry that practically begs to be sopped up by an onion seed-flecked naan.
"
285,"First on the agenda is finding this front door. This cocktail-slinging speakeasy is settled on the edge of Fort Greene Park and sequestered in the very back of Walter’s. While it could certainly thrive solely on its well-crafted drinks and moody, cool-kid vibe, the kitchen—which is no bigger than the size of an NYC apartment bathroom—refuses to play second fiddle. On the menu is a limited, Japanese-inspired tasting, with plenty of sumptuous surprises. Chawanmushi arrives warm, its texture custardy and the flavoring bold and rich. Chicken karaage is deftly fried and deliciously juicy; while prime rib marinated in koji is presented on a cast-iron pan with a dark, rigorous crust.Servers are cheerful and never take themselves too seriously. 
"
286,"At long last, pizza maestro Anthony Mangieri returns with this highly anticipated spot, decked out with an airy black- and white-tiled hall and a glass-front open kitchen.The chef tends to the wood-burning oven out of which 12-inch Neapolitan-style pies spring. And what glorious pies these are—with fluffy edges, papery crusts, and toppings ranging from bubbly gumdrops of mozzarella di bufala and sweet tomato sauce to peppery arugula and smoked mozzarella. These creations are the draw, though desserts deserve equal billing. Tempting selections worthy of consideration include panna cotta spiked with a cherry purée and finished with olive oil and balsamic, tiramisu with crunchy shards of caramel, bitter almond ice cream, and blonde orange sorbet.
"
287,"This beloved neighborhood bistro won locals’ hearts many moons ago, but Chef/owner/writer Gabrielle Hamilton's evolving talents keep them loyal. The tiny space packs a serious punch—both for its sweet décor, which is surprisingly comfy to linger in, and for the kitchen’s adventurous food. From greeting to check, Prune delivers the whole package. Both Hamilton and wife/co-chef Ashley Merriman create soulful and unpretentious dishes. Savor tender stewed tripe Lyonnaise in a luxurious broth with carrots, celery and bay leaf; or perfectly poached chicken in a deliciously restorative stock with ham and oxtail. Guests may watch the excitement unfold in the open kitchen while nursing a drink.Nightly specials, listed on the chalkboard, are always worth perusing. 
"
288,"The name of Akhtar Nawab’s stylish Mexican restaurant, Alta Calidad, means “high quality”—and this talented chef certainly puts his money where his mouth is. Even something as basic as the ""six tacos"" special with charred steak, shrimp, cauliflower, fish, and chicken tinga is deliciousness embodied. And if on offer, feast on their unique take on shrimp tempura tacos with salsa Ortega and chorizo powder, not to mention such sumptuous salsas as guajillo and salsa verde. Just ask your server if you'd like to take one to go.The restaurant's design is bright, airy, and modern, with light-flooded windows and and tables tucked into comfy banquettes. A communal table and cozy bar, lined with stools, is a great space to socialize and make new friends.
"
289,"This convivial tapas spot, compliments of Chef/co-owners Alex Raij and Eder Montero, is small but oh-so-warm and friendly. A bustling bar greets you upon entry; behind that lies a sweet little dining space with large windows, mismatched chairs and a huge woven mural. Service is engaging and attentive. The food may hit the table swiftly, but nonetheless, the multiple courses are very well paced.This kitchen has a talent for frying to perfection, but the highlight of the menu is arguably their lineup of warm, crusty bocadillos (sandwiches). The menu offers a full range of Spanish tapas that includes regional touches from areas like Andalusia, Asturias or Menorca—and clever creations like garlic shrimp with ginger and jalapeño or delicious shrimp po’ boy.
"
290,"Middle Eastern eateries are popping up faster than you can say labneh, but Miss Ada stands apart from the pack. This Fort Greene charmer delivers a one-two punch of good looks and great food. Rustic chic meets urban cool in the dining room, but wait, what’s that out back? It’s only the most darling backyard patio and garden, of course.Chef Tomer Blechman puts his own stamp on the ancient cuisine of the Middle East. Whipped ricotta with brown butter, sage, and honey may just convince you to set aside the flatbread and pick up a spoon, while smoky octopus is ramped up with grassy Castelvetrano olives. Hanger steak, bathed in a charred onion tahini, will have you begging for more. Even the wine list shows off some quirky and playful offerings. 
"
291,"Bringing a dose of Mexico City chic to the area, this restaurant takes its name from the ancient Mesoamerican fable of an ant and incorporates that imagery throughout the setting. Black-and-white checkerboard flooring, wall tiles bearing the insect's motif, and a cool giant ant mural reinforce the theme. The menu is an unrestricted look at this nation’s cuisine. It is only fitting that specialties here include the Climbing Ant cocktail with tequila, Aperol and mole bitters; guacamole seasoned with crushed ant salt; and grasshopper-crusted shrimp tacos. Bug-free creations are just as appealing, as in tacos with fried cod cheek and cabbage-mango slaw.For a more traditional but moodier experience, stop by sister restaurant Ofrenda in the West Village.
"
292,"There are wine bars and then there is this amazing concept from plant-based food guru, Matthew Kenney. But let's just dwell on this space for a moment. Outfitted with tall, communal tables, backlit wine shelves and artwork, the scene inside is sexy and urbane.With his unique vision behind Double Zero, the chef contends he is “crafting the future of food.” There is no dairy or meat here; and by the taste of things, no one is missing it either. A long, tantalizing lineup of low-gluten pizza and “not pizza” dominate the menu, along with occasional specials like wickedly good sweet potato cavatelli. A vegan cheese plate might feature creamy truffled cashew or almond ricotta. All chased down with exquisite organic wine? Food nirvana, indeed.
"
293,"This market-and-restaurant is an offshoot of an independent grocer in DUMBO, though its kitchen philosophy seems to have arrived via California. The dining room radiates functionality through large and unencumbered windows as well as basic hardwood tables. It’s staffed and patronized by the sort of local-loving sycophants who consider it an honor to dine here—and it actually is.The kitchen team will impress you with their skilled cooking featuring local produce from the market’s own farm in Columbia County. Pan-roasted duck breast, served with roasted celery root, juicy maple-glazed butternut squash, and sweet-savory cherry leek chutney offers a delicious medley of seasonal flavors, while the purple carrot cake with grilled pineapple is a visual treat. 
"
294,"This Prospect Heights collaboration, headed by Joe Campanale, is the kind of neighborhood spot you’ll want to make your go-to on first sight. The restaurant showcases an intimate, feel-good vibe; friendly service; and a deceptively simple but well-executed menu.The dining room is comfortable and replete with a small outdoor space that offers alfresco seating when the weather is right. Dinner might entail the likes of a whole Boston mackerel, wrapped in tender grape leaf and featuring a generous shake of herbs, lemon slices and creamy aïoli; or the sweet, milky house-made ricotta, laced with olive oil and candied almonds. A quenelle of rich chocolate crémeux topped with crunchy sea salt and toasted hazelnuts offers a beautiful and authentic finale. 
"
295,"One of the last-standing, old-time Eastern European spots on the Lower East Side, Katz’s is a true NY institution. It’s crowded, crazy and packed with a panoply of characters weirder than a jury duty pool. Tourists, hipsters, blue hairs and everybody in between flock here, so come on off-hours. Because it’s really that good. Walk inside, get a ticket and don’t lose it (those guys at the front aren’t hosts—upset their system and you’ll get a verbal beating). Then pick up your food at the counter and bring it to a first-come first-get table; or opt for a slightly less dizzying experience at a waitress-served table.Nothing’s changed in the looks or taste. Matzo ball soup, pastrami sandwiches, potato latkes—everything is what you’d expect, only better.
"
296,"Trailblazing Chef Alfred Portale, who spent 35 years gathering a passionate following at the critically-acclaimed Gotham Bar and Grill, strikes out on his own with this innovative Italian restaurant. Set in Chelsea, this is casual fine-dining at its peak, with a generous space that is minimally dressed, elegant and deeply intimate.The well-curated Italian menu is decidedly not bound by tradition; and the show-stopping house-made pastas—like cavatelli laced with a pitch-perfect arrabiata over a base of cilantro pesto—showcase Portale’s innovative style. Excellent duck, pork, roasted chicken and dry-aged steaks round out the entrée options, as do ethereal seafood plates like exquisitely cripsed cod bobbing in a lobster broth-based seafood stew. 
"
297,"It would be easy to underestimate this restaurant, located on an unremarkable corner and within the shell of a former pizzeria. However, that would be a shame, as the tasting menu, under the calm leadership of Chef Samuel Clonts, is anything but ordinary. In fact, diners can expect a wonderful and surprising meal with an eye towards finesse.From honeynut squash with barley miso to Berkshire pork short ribs with caramelized shallot sauce, this kitchen team treats its top-quality ingredients with refined techniques. Inspired by his time in Arizona and at Bar Uchu, Chef Clonts prepares a taco with soft ajitama, fried potato, and trout roe; as well as a handroll full of caviar and rice. Dessert includes his mother's recipe for peach-and-strawberry pie.
"
298,"Named after Count Camillo Negroni, the legendary inventor of the “perfect cocktail,” this Roman-themed restaurant has the same contemporary yet warm Italian style that’s made its sibling (Locanda Vini e Olii) a hit. Dressed in subtle shades of slate and green, the space boasts a sizable front bar, ideal for enjoying one of the nine Negroni variations on offer. The menu must-try is pinsa, a lighter Roman cousin to the Neapolitan pizza that’s baked to a crisp. While one version may unveil the flavors of a classic Margherita, it's the half amatriciana-half cacio e pepe that captures many a heart, thanks to ample doses of pecorino Romano and black pepper. Save room for the vegetarian carbonara, which swaps zucchini in for guanciale.
"
299,"This marriage between Tocqueville and 15 East arrives courtesy of Executive Chef and Owner Marco Moreira. Glass-framed doors and potted plants welcome patrons to this contemporary retreat. It's a convivial place, so book ahead and expect a plethora of polished plates that can be enjoyed both inside or out—on the attractive patio.From sushi and sashimi to some of the most delicious soba this side of the pond, they have it all.A bowl of noodles may arrive crowned by top-grade ikura, uni, and caviar, all rich with umami. Then expect an irresistibly flavorful preparation of venison with smoked bacon, potato mousseline, and salsify. It would be a pity to skip dessert, so indulge in the gluten-free Mineoka tofu with milk sesame pudding and tomato husk compote.
"
300,"Find this Japanese culinary temple tucked into a subterranean space that feels more like a modern lounge. Enter to discover a mere smattering of deep-seated chairs, coffee tables, green glass table lamps, as well as a few area rugs strewn about. A record player spinning vinyl enhances the overall intimate and library-like vibe.Yoshoku is the focus of this kitchen's style, with the likes of karaage, udon, sandos, and curry complete with their own creative twists. Case in point: the Aoi katsu is a fried ham cutlet, complemented by savory tonkatsu sauce, fried bites and perfectly tangy pickles. The teishoku set is presented on a light wood tray and may proffer miso soup, yellowtail sashimi, campari tomato marinated in sugar, and yuzu with sudachi jelly.
"
301,"Contrary to what the gym on the ground floor of the building might suggest, this dining room is hardly the place to eat lean. Blame restaurateur Stephen Starr, whose team turns out a wholly satisfying, oft-creative menu that weaves in global flavors with convincing suaveness. And like so many of Starr’s restaurants, the space is a real stunner with high ceilings, gorgeous views, and elegant mid-century modern touches.Find evidence of these international influences in the beef tartare—stuffed into egg crêpes and served with smoked oyster sauce—as well as the roasted black bass paired with poblano and avocado salsa and corn tortillas. When it comes to dessert, don’t feel guilty if you finish the froyo with lovage meringue and juiced green herbs.
"
302,"After opening a series of successful ramen shops in Tokyo, Ivan Orkin could not have picked a better location for his NY flagship. Indie rock beats, designer tees, and murals of manga cutouts come together seamlessly at this Clinton Street spot; and from solo stools along the wall to counter seats facing the kitchen, the snug little space has packed in the crowds since opening in 2014.Starters like crispy eggplant with tahini and charred garlic or cold sesame noodles with roasted peppers showcase the chef's preference for flair and flavor. Ordering ramen is non-negotiable. Friendly servers will push the house favorite—chicken paitan with shio kombu and egg yolk, but the classic tonkotsu with shoyu-glazed chashu and black garlic oil is a bolder delight.
"
303,"Since the mid-eighties, this local darling has been doing solid business thanks to its elevated ingredients, skilled kitchen and excellent value. For around $20, the soba lunch set will warm the heart of any frugal fan of Japanese cuisine. This feast unveils a bowl of green tea noodles in hot, crystal-clear dashi stocked with wilted water spinach and fish cake, accompanied by lean tuna chirashi, yellowtail and kanpyō. The ten-don, a jumbo shrimp tempura served over rice, is just as enticing. The à la carte offerings draw crowds seeking seasonal fish sourced from Japan as well as a host of tasty cooked preparations.Diners who make their way into this minimalist dining room may choose to sit at one of their many wood tables or sizable counter.
"
304,"Wander past Scampi and you’re likely to stop in your tracks, if only to glimpse its stunning interior. Lofty windows afford fantastic vistas into this modern, nautical lair, with beautiful furnishings, striking lights and abundant greenery.Chef PJ Calapa pays homage to his Southern Italian roots on the menu. Seafood is a staple, starring sweet and briny razor clams tossed with olive oil, as well as chopped Manila clams finished with a salty kick from prosciutto. While tuna acqua pazza offers a peppy take on tartare with chili oil and jalapeños, this kitchen truly shines during pasta time. Despite a rustic lean, there is clear skill in the curly edged ribbons of mafaldini with shrimp scampi, or spaghetti with 'nduja, squid and mint.
"
305,"It's a mod, mod world at this two-level slickster in the East Village, where gray-and-white tiles, metal tables and clear, plastic chairs show off a contemporary flair. The name tips off what they do very well, but dumplings (even really delicious ones) are only half the story. The menu also leans into seafood and Chinese-style tapas.There are flashy dishes, like uni dumplings made with squid ink-tinted wrappers and dusted with gold powder, but some of the best dishes are dressed down but offer amped-up flavor. Sichuan-style dumplings in a mouth-numbing chili oil and peanut sauce bring the heat, while pan-fried zucchini and cucumber keep things light (order more from your phone). The truffled shrimp toast is a very grown-up snack.  
"
306,"The same team behind Kosaka has leveled the playing field by throwing open the doors of this more casual yet equally delightful iteration. The space is fitted out with counters inside, while outdoor dining is abuzz during warmer weather. The carte is basic, affordable, and especially appealing, as evidenced by the routine lineup of diners. Sets of onigiri are the way to go here, alongside a plethora of maki, handrolls, and other specials. Highlights may reveal wonderful ceviche-style preparations, like kampachi imbued with yuzu kosho and accompanied by radish slices; king salmon with scallion shiro dare and sesame seeds for great texture; as well as sea scallop with a mound of seared Hokkaido uni and soy sauce for a refreshing pop of flavor and finish.
"
307,"This is an intimate and attractive operation in the heart of the Flatiron District. Add on a warm welcome, impeccable service and inventive food—no wonder it's a hit. While the city may boast many a Mexican spot, this inviting and high-end concept bucks the trend by way of spacious tables that afford privacy, a tempting bar and custom blue-gray tiles.The menu is a veritable sensory thrill via ingredient combos that are seemingly familiar yet deliciously creative. Big eye tuna crudo with avocado crema makes a bright kickoff and may be tailed by sea bass ceviche with gooseberry. Scallop aguachile showcases finger lime as a perfect counterpoint to the mild cucumber; while birria tacos arrive with salsa negra and a bowl of savory broth for dipping.
"
308,"There are a ton of Japanese restaurants that line this stretch of the East Village, so why Soba-Ya? Why not Soba-Ya, its ultra-dedicated patrons would argue, for the buckwheat soba, as well as the hearty udon on tap here, are consistently off-the-charts good. Co-owner and mini-mogul, Bon Yagi, favors authenticity over flash in his establishments. And here he employs that traditional aesthetic to sweet perfection—along with a graceful, but simply appointed dining space; and quiet, well-timed service.A meal might begin with uni and grated mountain yam, kissed with wasabi and crispy, toasted nori. Then, transition to a seasonal noodle dish like warm soba mingled with plump, pickled oysters, mountain yam, cilantro and tempura root vegetables.
"
309,"What started as a bakery is now a brunch-focused legend—one that draws a perpetual crowd waiting for ample rewards. A little bit country and a little bit food lab, this kitchen has achieved such success that the owners now have outposts in Japan and Dubai. Here in Gotham, the space is comfy and the service, impressive. A light chicken tortilla soup sees a pile of fried tortilla strips over a hearty broth bobbing with carrots, celery and shredded chicken. While savory dishes thread this menu, it's breakfast that steals the show. Imagine a union of sweet and savory in the golden Belgian waffles with warm maple butter and buttermilk-brined fried chicken; or brioche French toast enriched with walnuts.Credit cards are accepted, even welcomed, at dinnertime. 
"
310,"As its name in Greek suggests, this stunner is making “waves” in town by way of Roslyn, New York. The bi-level space transports diners to the Ionian Sea but it’s not just beauty that bewitches here. All Hellenic meals begin with a panoply of spreads, so using a warm pita, scoop up the pikilia trio with feta, hummus and taramasalata. Calamari stuffed with four cheeses and served over a Nafpaktos tomato sauce is a winner. Not far behind, find that phyllo-wrapped spanakopita delight with spinach and cheese. The menu also lists a series of fresh-caught fish ready for “your pleasure.” Carnivores though will also get their fill by way of the short rib youvetsi.Ekmek kataifi featuring shredded phyllo and semolina custard is a fine way to end this Greek feast.
"
311,"Nothing says “authentic sushi” more than an elusive or, in this case, non-existent sign outside. The interior, though, eschews the bare aesthetic of traditional sushi-yas and opts instead for something more flamboyant and theatrical—the space, after all, was once a speakeasy and gambling parlor. There’s even a small bar, which means you don’t have to time your arrival to the dot but can gather first for a cocktail.Chef Shigeyuki Tsunoda undertakes his duties with calm, unhurried efficiency and his omakase—in contrast to the surroundings—is rooted in tradition. Before the Edomae-style nigiri come various snacks that are especially enjoyable when paired with something from their broad range of nihonshu. A seasonal soup and creamy chawanmushi with generous spoonfuls of both Hokkaido uni and Osetra caviar are followed by tender abalone, rich red bonito, succulent scallop, and other mouthfuls of delight. The nigiri is an easy-to-eat size and the rice is body temperature so its flavor really comes through.The exquisite counter seats just eight and its semicircular shape allows you to check out your fellow diners. Everyone is served together and there are two seatings a night.
"
312,"Huertas is lovely—even lovelier than you might expect given its gritty location, and now, its no-tipping policy. The casual space is deep, with a long bar pouring cider or sherry, a dedicated counter where a host of cured meats including jamón is sliced, and larger tables in the back.The Basque-leaning menu showcases pintxos like stuffed and batter-fried squash blossoms, duck croquetas and skewers of white anchovies with olives and pickled peppers. Chorizo over tender Basque-style beans is a winning dish, as is the especially tasty, rustic sardines with crusty bread. Choose the ""let us cook"" option and they'll present a selection of family-style dishes that are just right for sampling a variety.
"
313,"Despite a clandestine vibe and handful of seats, this dining room buzzes with diners and locals in-the-know. Low lighting creates a sultry aura and courteous servers attend to the pristine counter with ease. The space feels especially intimate and private. Plush leather seats, a gleaming kitchen, and top fittings hint at a classic and celebratory meal. The kaiseki follows a distinct format by staring with a seasonal small plate, followed by soup, a grilled dish, and fried preparation. Sushi, like aged squid with bottarga, is an added bonus. Kick off with sakizuke, like broccoli rabe and fried taro with seared Long Island unagi. Then indulge in a flavorful owan, soup course, with Alaskan king crab; tailed by yakimono of duck with a frothy apple cream.

"
314,"A blue-and-white awning welcomes diners to this culinary retreat. Vast in comparison to its neighbors, the space flaunts such rustic affects as a white-painted brick wall, fabric squares, and dark wood tables scattered throughout. Speaking of which, these may be occupied by buzzy patrons, noshing on Japanese curry—fruit-based and sweeter than its Indian cousin.Chef Kelly Cho impresses with her dry curry, cooked with ground beef and paired with white rice. While the latter may be reminiscent of a sloppy Joe, its flavors are ramped up and ultra-refined. Yaki curry, a casserole-style dish with rice and ground beef topped with melted cheese, delivers the richness that leaves one wanting  more. Lighter bites, like seaweed salad, are as good as they are simple.
"
315,"Relaxing and stylish for grown-ups, Periyali serves the kind of straightforward Greek cooking that remains blissfully unconcerned with trends. Think grilled octopus is boring? Think again, when presented with charcoal-grilled morsels, marinated for two days in red wine and finished with olive oil and parsley sauce. Salmon may not be native to Greece, but it gets its due respect here, wrapped with herbs and baked in phyllo, served alongside stewed okra. A puréed dish of fava kremidaki showcases a terrific blend of textures, colors and flavors that is the heart and soul of this rustic kitchen.The dining room echoes the culinary theme with a suspended wall of shimmering decorative fish, abundant flower arrangements, and a back room flooded with natural light.
"
316,"When you consider the fact that the owner is an artist-turned-chef, it’s no revelation that this long and slender East Village incomer is so beautifully conceived. Its décor boasts a modern aesthetic, cleverly incorporating the use of raw materials like exposed bulbs and wooden slats. That fused with a bit of great taste makes this one of the most sleek and affable spots downtown.Suitably baptized, this “slurp shop” is a noteworthy destination for noodles—specifically mifen—which originally hail from Southwest China. Heartier appetites, though, will find much to savor in skewered cumin beef; or smoked pork and tofu slivers sautéed with garlic and scallions. Everyone should get the house-made salted chili oil to add a dose of flavor and spice.
"
317,"A compact operation serving a creative Korean carte infused with modern touches, Oiji is all about small plates-style dining. Donning such basic design elements as exposed brick walls, slate-like floors, and a blue-gray wood banquette,  this team is led by Chef/co-owners Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, who were both born in Korean and met stateside at the CIA.An open kitchen in the back offers sneak peeks of the adept chefs as they prepare a cuisine rooted in tradition, but replete with refinement. Begin with a wrap of Wagyu slices, brushed with barbecue sauce and topped with sautéed maitakes. Raw scallop slices may then arrive atop shredded snow crab; while vanilla bean ice cream surrounded by potato crisps doused in honey butter boasts of enticing flavors.
"
318,"This simple yet stylish and welcoming ""bistro"" exudes all the modern feels. Imagine a long, rectangular space furnished with dark wood banquettes, industrial-style light fixtures, and lush planters. Service is swift yet helpful; while hearty, lip-scorching Hunan food is on the menu—and everyone’s just a little bit happier for it.Dinner here might kick off with such typical specialties as sour string beans sautéed with minced pork, chillies, and toothsome konjac noodles. Next up, the likes of pork belly braised in their signature soy- rice wine- and star anise-broth, best eaten with greens and a mound of soft white rice. Finally, fish dusted with cumin and set in a warm, toasted sesame seed-infused oil, hints at the raw firepower of this heady feast.
"
319,"Add this delicious venture to the growing list of Chinese restaurants that are finally giving Manhattanites a chance to feast on spice levels once reserved for the outer boroughs. Inside MáLà Project’s two rooms, find seating that includes a long, group-friendly communal table tucked into a nook, exposed brick walls, beautiful floors and big green leafy plants.Dinner could go in any number of delicious directions, but a MáLà dry pot is really the best option. Diners are given a choice of ingredients—meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables, rice—and then asked for their desired degree of spiciness. A pot of lamb, bok choy, wood ear mushrooms, shrimp balls and chicken gizzards make their way into a wok with a fragrant “secret sauce” and complex spiced oil.
"
320,"Tucked along the fringes of Alphabet City, a little taste of authentic Isaan Thai awaits. Originally based out of Bangkok, the New York outpost of Somtum Der offers a cozy little enclave for the East Village set, stylishly accented with bright pops of red and a welcome glimpse of the kitchen’s somtum station. There, you’ll spy large glass jars of peanuts, dried red chilies and spices—the contents of which are ground by mortar and pestle to produce what some claim is the city’s best green papaya salad.Order big here, for the portions aren’t massive and the food is so terrific you’ll inevitably want more. The kitchen is happy to kick things up a notch, spice-wise, but you’ll need to request the hotter end of the spectrum for greater authenticity.
"
321,"This bijou flies under the radar somewhat, and that’s just the way their loyal fan base likes it. Those who understand the fine art of tempura know how pristine the quality is here, where diners are treated to a mouthwatering omakase featuring succulent red shrimp, Japanese eggplant, and meaty king crab. You probably won’t need it, but a choice of lemon, wasabi salt and charcoal salt is provided as enhancements.The man to thank for these treats is Chef Yokota, who takes his craft (and business) seriously, putting his clients first. Dining here is an intimate and deeply personal experience that highlights ingredients sourced mostly from Japan. As a bonus, his tempura is typically bookended by unique dishes that display his French culinary training.
"
322,"There is nothing homey about Chef Dani Garcia’s sprawling new casa, located in the sparkling Citizens food hall in Manhattan West. A buzzy lounge opens into a packed two-story dining room that is full-on glamour with ceilings that reach for the sky, a glassed-in open kitchen, beautiful fabric and texture at every corner and a professional clientele that likes to eat well and look good doing it. Big groups like to swing for the pricey paella, but we suggest building a meal around a wide range of small dishes, starting with any one of the fantastic preparations of tuna. A richly satisfying and unexpectedly creamy tortilla española as well as expertly fried buñuelos de mi madre (cod fritters) are wonderful benchmarks from this famed chef.
"
323,"Sorry Texas, this ""yellow rose"" belongs to the bustling East Village and announces its arrival via a striped awning and bright green sign. Inside, it's quaint and vintage in every way—with a takeout window and set of saloon doors that lead to the main dining room. Amidst this setting of weathered wood and stained glass chandeliers, diners can be found devouring Tex-Mex food with a focus on tacos and inspired cocktails.Flour tortillas are made in house daily and feature in a myriad of deliciously dressed-down creations—from the Migas tacos with simmered tortilla chips to the more hearty carne guisada. Wild boar and grits are a sumptuous mainstay, but those with sweet on their mind should go straight for the nostalgic Texas Sheet cake with candied pecans.-
"
324,"For a taste of something different, make a beeline to this unique Hawaiian-flavored spot. Headed by a trio of Per Se veterans, Noreetuh features an intimate setting of two slender dining rooms adorned with hexagonal mirrors and shelving units used to store bottles from the impressive wine list.The kitchen turns out contemporary and sophisticated interpretations of Hawaiian cuisine. Classics like the humble musubi is elevated with the likes of pork jowl and beef tongue, while the parmesan cheese-topped Kalua pork cavatelli's richness is balanced by perfect portions of pickled cabbage. Imported ingredients such as shrimp from Kauai and the famous King's Hawaiian sweet bread are sure to invoke nostalgia among the expats.
"
325,"Efficient, busy from the minute doors open and effortlessly likable, this Italian eatery hiding deep inside the Manhattan West development is everything we’ve come to expect—and enjoy—from restaurateur Danny Meyer. The space features a handsome bar, open kitchen, large windows and ample tilework—all of which will feel familiar to those acquainted with the Union Square Hospitality Group.Chef Hillary Sterling's food is equally inviting. The caramelized onion torta is enough to warrant a return, with melting onions packed into a delicate crust, buried under two kinds of pecorino and finished in the wood-burning oven. Generously rich pastas and hearty proteins are designed for sharing. A simple but arresting lemon torta with mascarpone and olive oil closes out the meal.
"
326,"The inside is quaint with vintage touches, like weathered wood beams on the ceiling and a bar fitted out with an antique telephone and bright neon sign. Tables with tufted red leather booths, lanterns, and a charming back garden keep the vibe inviting. The menu is a large, modern Thai affair, so come with a crew to sample its many regional offerings.Start with steamed jeep dumplings, filled with ground shrimp, pork, and topped with crispy garlic. A simple salad of sweet-and-sour pomelo, red onion, and grilled shrimp reaches inventive heights when dressed with hahm pla whan. Pair their daily iteration of sticky rice (chestnuts and salted duck egg yolk, anyone?) with a gemstone-christened cocktail (Rose Quartz?) to understand what all the fuss is about.
"
327,"Restaurateurs Yen Ngo and Chef Hannah Wong are the brains behind this fantastic and exciting offering in the East Village. Noting the deficiency in popular Vietnamese restaurants around town, the duo set out to offer the same nation's lesser-known specialties. With a mission to introduce city-dwellers to specialties that go beyond bahn mi and pho, this menu is divided into street food from different regions, including Hanoi, Hue, and Saigon—each sporting their own style. Standout dishes may include turmeric griddle cake with wild mushrooms and coconut custard; crisped, delightfully chewy mochi balls; and tapioca dumplings steamed in banana leaves.Round out your meal with a well-priced creative sip—a rarity in this craft cocktail-centric city.
"
328,"For a fine drinking experience paired with food rather than the other way around, stop at this speakeasy, nestled within Amor y Amargo. Once guests are assembled, a sliding door opens to reveal a well-lit space with tiles of varying shape and a stocked bar. The counter, though, is where the fireworks unfurl.Along with partner Ravi DeRossi, Sother Teague expanded this matchbox-sized bar to offer a tasting menu. The only caveat—the former butcher-turned-barkeep is focused on vegan cuisine. Highlights include crisp orange-scented cauliflower with raisin-caper emulsion or beans on toast with garlic confit, blistered tomatoes, and mint oil. Drinks are nuanced and a point of pride, as in Zipper Skin with Southern Amaro or CAB with Branca Menta.
"
329,"The spotlight here is on the talented Chef Nobuyuki Shikanai, who commands the room’s attention as he performs his magic before the few coveted seats along his counter. Beyond this, the space has a row of tables where you might observe a group indulging in a tuna rib that appears large enough to feed an army. Unlike the monastic aura often found elsewhere, the mood at this restaurant is upbeat and service is swift.Omakase is the best way to sample the team's artistry. It's also profoundly personal, as each morsel arrives in cupped hands to be enjoyed with your fingers. Pieces are precise in that traditional Edomae style. Overall, the meal is a progression from light and firm fish to vivid and buttery varieties, with exciting stops along the way.
"
330,"Ruffian is tiny but mighty. This quirky gem has grunge chic down pat and has been hiding in plain sight turning out a host of creative dishes. Just like the diminutive space, the menu is equally small scale, featuring seasonal touches as it evolves from day to day. Braised fennel with a kosho aïoli and resting in red pepper purée is sweet and spicy, while roasted carrots are ramped up with a ginger labneh, dusted with house-made rendang powder and dots of honeycomb for an intensely flavorful and unexpected surprise. Then there is the short rib borscht, with its meltingly tender meat and vibrant red purée.Popular with industry types, they take no reservations, so be prepared to wait. However, a worthy wine list will help bide your time. 
"
331,"Restaurateur Christos Valtzoglou has found a winning formula with this longstanding hideaway, which continues to sparkle as brightly as the Aegean Sea on a summer day. Taking its name from the Greek translation of “made from clay,” this contemporary taverna also features a ceiling canopy of suspended terra-cotta pots, rustic whitewashed walls and lapis-blue insets.Pale-green stemware and stark-white crockery are used to serve wines from the homeland as well as a menu of rustic, home-style food. Keftedakia are light and texturally exquisite meatballs, pan fried in olive oil and proffered as an appetizer. Gigantes are baked in honey-scented tomato-dill sauce; while aginares moussaka is a creamy vegetarian take on the classic, made here with artichokes.
"
332,"There’s a saying that good things come in small packages. That is certainly true for this heartfelt Burmese jewel—its stark-white interior no bigger than a train car. The menu, too, is limited to a handful of vibrant salads, soothing noodles, and curries that reflect the country’s cross-cultural cooking influenced by neighbors like China, Thailand and India.However, unlike its neighbors, creations like tea leaf salad with fried beans or lemongrass fish noodle soup with garlic oil showcase a subtler approach to spice and flavor that's as comforting as a gentle summer breeze. If there is such a thing as a perfect starter, it must be the onion fritters served with tamarind-garlic dip. They are onion rings perfected and are as pretty as they are delicious.
"
333,"This tight but artsy little jewel box of a restaurant, courtesy of Ravi DeRossi, aims to give vegan food some well-deserved polish. Avant Garden’s dynamic menu couldn’t have arrived at a better time, as New York diners are hungry for more upscale meatless options. This is excellent food that just happens to be vegan.Try the cold, salt-baked sweet potato with puréed watercress, crispy jicama and Meyer lemon; or deep-fried sushi rice topped with avocado, smashed ginger, sesame seeds, and streaks of miso paste. Sheets of pasta are tossed with pesto, tomatoes, haricot verts, and Kalamata olives. Their thick slices of toast topped with cremini mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, toasted walnuts, and herbes de Provence are destined to become a signature item.
"
334,"""Simplicity is the peak of elegance"" seems a fitting adage for this stunning kaiseki counter. In Japanese, ""tsukimi"" means moon viewing (a harvest festival honoring the moon at its fullest and brightest); and following the moniker quite literally is a central motif of the moon. Illuminated shelves of ceramics and mirrored panels reinforce this light-bright aesthetic. Service is seamless and unaffected, enhancing the overall experience.The progression of the these whimsical, seasonal courses is strategic and imaginative. To start, chilled caviar with warm scrambled eggs and potato purée. Up next, chopped scallop matched with sea buckthorn sauce and a nori crisp for crunch.Beverage pairing is available, but stick to à la carte for an ace sake selection.
"
335,"Classically trained Chef Thomas Chen is the one to thank for the fabulous Tuome. It's an Asian-inspired menu, which is no surprise as the chef is a master of weaving together ingredients to delicious and surprising effect. The intimate space is outfitted with a backlit bar, bay windows, and comfy purple seats. Service is fittingly unfussy yet deeply knowledgeable. Don’t miss the humble crispy chicken, elevated with rice porridge; or seared scallops with puffed amaranth and sweet corn sabayon. Still not convinced? Delectably tender octopus with pommes aligot is, to put it simply, textbook.Deep-fried buns, which arrive as Chinese “beignets” full of apple jam and accompanied by vanilla ice cream laced with red bean paste, renders dessert wholly unmissable.
"
336,"The little menu at this neighborhood fixture proves that quality trumps size. Lavagna’s kitchen is snug, but still manages to make ample use of a wood-burning oven to bake everything from delicate pizzette to whole roasted fish. Pastas are always a treat, while other tasty options may include pan-fried smoked scamorza paired with a roasted red pepper-topped crostini, juicy rack of lamb or a slice of spot-on crostata filled with seasonal fruit and dressed with caramel sauce.Framed mirrors, a pressed-tin ceiling and candlelight produce a mood that is almost as warm as the genuinely gracious service, which ensures that regulars receive the royal treatment. That said, everyone who steps through these doors will feel welcome and well taken care of.
"
337,"From first glance, Kura is everything that a personal, well-run and authentic Japanese restaurant should be. Inside, the itamae, who don traditional samue, greet each guest who approaches the L-shaped counter while continuing to prepare the next course. Also find a few tables in the front of the room where groups manage to squeeze in.The menu offers four different levels of omakase, beginning with the likes of braised fava beans; a whole stuffed squid brushed with a sweet-salty reduction; as well as rice topped with nori and ikura. Settle in to the ten-piece nigiri, presented as an array of hyper-seasonal fish dabbed with soy, gently torched or wrapped with cured cherry leaf. Finish with a familiar and delicious cube of chilled tamago and miso soup.
"
338,"It’s been years since Tom Colicchio first opened Craft to great acclaim, but the easy charms of the celebrity chef and TV personality’s downtown institution haven’t waned a bit. The room is still busy most nights of the week with stylish patrons who appreciate the triple threat of cozy décor, elegant food and a crackerjack service team.As the name suggests, guests ""craft"" a meal from seasonal, perfectly executed dishes that may feature pristine ingredients. Dinner might kick off with a cured slice of crudo, served with shaved fennel, radish and microgreens in a Meyer lemon dressing. Don’t leave without trying one of the chef's legendary pastas, like a gorgeous tangle of capellini with lemon zest, grated cheese, ramps and Calabrian chilies.
"
339,"This elder member of David Chang’s culinary empire is hipper and hotter than ever. A honey-toned temple of updated comfort food, decked with wood counters and a sparkling open kitchen, the service here may be brisk. But rest assured, as the menu is gutsy and molded with Asian street food in mind.Those steamed buns have amassed a gargantuan following thanks to decadent fillings like moist pork loin kissed with Hollandaise and chives. Additionally, that bowl of springy noodles doused in a spicy ginger-scallion sauce is just one instance of the crew’s signature work. Korean fried chicken with seasonal greens is fit for a king; while more modest items, including desserts like candy apple truffle, are beautifully crafted and rightfully elevated to global fame.
"
340,"While regulars at this beloved Clinton Hill jewel know just where to go, the uninitiated may be surprised to find it tucked underneath a sign that reads Lewis Drug Store. Old-school without feeling hyper-designed, the ambience at this re-purposed apothecary is truly special. Envision lace-covered windows, a penny-tile floor and ladder-fronted shelves filled with vintage glassware and cookbooks.Tuscany influences the cooking here, where the diverse list of antipasti includes tripe alla Fiorentina, and the pasta is expertly prepared, like a luscious tangle of chitarra con le sarde. Salads follow entrées on the menu, but no one will raise an eyebrow if you order the baby spinach with roasted beets and pecorino before the charred poussin al mattone.
"
341,"This “Korean inspired” restaurant makes a refreshing change in charming Gramercy Park. The fact that it is brought to life by the same team behind K-Town's very own Osamil makes it one of the best dining options around. Following in the same inspired vein, diners will not go wrong with any of the items listed on their brief yet bold menu.Of course, most make an inevitable start with a plate of those deliciously sticky chicken wings, famously doubly fried and flavorfully aggrandized by salt and pepper or soy sauce and garlic. Follow this up with ""pizza"" di mar, starring mussels, scallops, rock shrimp, and—surprise—Parmigiano and mozzarella; or bi bim bap with quinoa, uni, wasabi tobiko, and seaweed purée. Sign on the line with an enticing espresso martini.
"
342,"This fabled NY icon is high on most people's roll call. It's one of those places that manage the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities and can be all things to all diners. You’ll probably leave happy whether you’re here on a date, to impress the in-laws, or seal a deal. The “Tavern” side is a prized spot for lunch, especially if you can sit at the bar. It doesn't take reservations so get here early. The “Dining Room” though is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle and truly comes to life at night. Service is attentive throughout.Focused on impeccable products, the seasonal and creative American cuisine is a perfect match for the woody surrounds. It's also sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary.
"
343,"If you’ve been lucky enough to sample the ethereal cuisine of Emilia-Romagna, you’re in for a treat at Chef Stefano Secchi's cherished osteria. Nestled into a well-designed space in the Flatiron District, this cheerful spot brings the Italian region’s signature cuisine stateside.Rotating specials and pastas top the charts, and the regional pasta tasting is a sleeper hit. It takes guts to serve a handful of penne with pomodoro sauce or two tortellini in chicken brodo, but when pasta is as refined as this, nobody is complaining. Starters like the feather-light gnocco fritto with mortadella and Prosciutto di Parma, bookended by an appealingly restrained dessert like parmesan cheesecake crowned by citrus gelée all but guarantee a return visit.
"
344,"There’s something reassuring about a kitchen that gets in whole beasts and does its own butchery—you just know it understands the essence of what good cooking is all about. Here at the small but perfectly formed Casa Mono, dishes are none of those one-bite wonders that blight so many places these days. Nor do they arrive in a stampede at your table. Instead, they are sent out in a sensible order, for the benefit of the diner rather than the convenience of the kitchen.The cuisine is nominally influenced by the Costa Brava, but its reach is far greater than that and the tapas are especially refined. Scrambled eggs with uni is a must, while confit goat will make you question why you don’t see more of it on other menus. This is food to cure what ails you.
"
345,"This high dining, hyper-sustainable operation is proudly unbound by tradition. The space is quaint and deviates from the blonde-wood minimalism so prevalent these days. Instead, find hues of cerulean blue and a counter (made from a tree that was a Sandy casualty) that blazes its own trail. À la carte is available, but go for the tasting menu. Farro miso from PA, yuzu from NJ, and tuna from the Carolinas show dedication to sourcing. In terms of cuisine, the style is contemporary elegance, as seen in shrimp nigiri that's first cured, then seared until it curls into the rice, and finished with shrimp head-chili oil. End with amazake, presented as a porridge with white peach-nectarine jam.An impressive wine list sources from the North Fork and west coast.
"
346,"Junoon has reemerged on the scene and its new incarnation is nothing short of striking. Featuring a series of spaces (the front area is primarily suited for a bite and bevy), the reprized décor flaunts pendant lights strung with thick grass ropes, vintage mirrors, and a gleaming white marble bar. Speaking of, teetotalers rejoice as the mocktails alone (a cucumber collins, anyone?) are worth a letter home.Bold Indian flavors and elegant platings are par for the course. The menu certainly makes the most of goat as a whole. To wit: toasted brioche with goat brain; or las mas (goat cooked with Mathania red chili and smoked mustard oil). Savory dal makhani calls for a house-spiced naan; while desserts, like Ma's rice pudding, are a consummate denouement. 
"
347,"Park Avenue South may be brimming with restaurants—from expense account beauties to the massively trendy—but this dining room will stop you in your tracks. First with its looks (imagine an inviting bar that anchors the room up front, while the back is crowned by a raw bar and sushi counter); and then with its enticing cooking.If the glistening items on ice didn't give you the hint, seafood reigns, with local plus global sourcing and preparations ranging from ceviche and sushi to towering platters and delicious entrées. Toro tartare with caviar is a particular highlight, as is the East-meets-West Alaskan black cod with a sake glaze, braised bok choy, mushroom and yuzu dashi. Buttermilk panna cotta with cranberry mousse is a great way to wrap things up. 
"
348,"An integral part of Manhattan's culinary scene, Union Square Cafe is big, bi-level and beautiful. The bar is perpetually abuzz with achingly trendy types, but with such a versatile and approachable menu boasting something for even the most picky eater, who can really complain?Nobody does relaxed elegance like Danny Meyer, and this café is no exception. Service is exemplary whether you’re a local or Broadway star, and diners love the kitchen's upmarket take on crowd faves—everything from the hearty burger to a silky and savory cauliflower sformato that is surrounded by tender, flavorful romanesco (brassica). And with an option like the triple-layer chocolate cake with locally roasted espresso ganache on the carte, you’d be crazy to skip dessert.
"
349,"Legacy Records is hip personified—down to every last detail. Its art deco interior is defined by gold-accented trim, tile floors, and burgundy leather-topped tables. Cocktails are smartly divided into styles, namely light beginning, weightier middle, or stout nightcap.The dishes are remarkable and treated with great care. The menu may meander the Med, but its soul is Italian. Crudi run the gamut—red snapper with cilantro-citrus emulsion and bay scallop are solid stunners. Torchio tossed with giant surf clam, saffron, and lemon balm has a terrific bite, but they save the best for last here, with an intriguing and seductive meringata with a boozy, black pepper-infused Venezuelan rum cake. 
"
350,"Ordering guacamole may be a reflex for many, but at Chavela’s, what lands on the table is far from the norm. Mexico City native, Chef Arturo Leonar, is the brains behind this exceptional riff, which mixes smoked trout, pico de gallo, and morita chile salsa to thrilling effect. His creativity even extends to other dishes, like taquitos de cangrego with sweet crabmeat and spicy salsa verde, as well as handmade quesadillas stuffed with huitlacoche. Traditionalists may rest easy, as the subtly sweet mole coating the chicken and enchiladas alike is bound to delight.Featuring a wrought-iron entrance door, the décor here is an absolute riot of color thanks to vibrant Mexican tiles surrounding the bar and artistic touches like that wall of ceramic butterflies.
"
351,"Donning a hip and urbane demeanor, Cosme is a cherished destination. This contemporary space features a sleek and handsome bar up front that pours a litany of stirring cocktails. Then add in the roomy dining tables and soft lighting to its playful Mexican food from a skilled kitchen team, and you have quite the winning formula.One glance at the menu will also tell you why this kitchen is so beloved. Duck carnitas, though pricey, are impressive with their perfectly cooked and crisped duck and eye-catching cast iron skillet plating, but it's the flavorful sweet, spicy, and nutty cobia al pastor that is an utter delight. This cooking is clever, and, at times, surprisingly delicate. Husk meringue, filled with corn mousse, is a dessert staple. 
"
352,"Duck your head into this beloved old guard, its loyal patrons buzzing about as happy as ever, to get a sense of what the fuss is all about. This kitchen is still all about delicious Italian, yes, but now the ingredients are more carefully sourced, on the healthy side and with a deep commitment to GMO-free grains, less butter and no processed oils.Chef Marco Canora's focus on vegetables, grains and brodi is a winning combo; make sure to begin with their warm whole-grain bread with creamy lardo. Then Sorana beans are braised to perfection with garlic and mackerel “bottarga;” while cured egg yolk and chervil tops carrot and beet tartare. Meat lovers take heart—Hearth’s excellent maccheroni pork ragù, ""variety burger,"" and meatballs are still available.
"
353,"You can't throw a stone without hitting a Michele Iuliano’s restaurant these days and for good reason. This original outpost of Luzzo's boasts a colorful exterior, exposed brick interior, and a century-old coal-burning oven that pushes out not only ace pizzas, but playful Neapolitan eats like burrata and la quadrata or a simple bietole with beets, asparagus, and polpettine.Gauging from the crowd, these locals know a good menu when they see it—and this one has much to offer. While there are salads, antipasto, and pasta on the menu, this kitchen is clearly about Neapolitan-style pizzas, like brutta ma buona with tomato sauce, sausage, and ricotta; as well as the EST, starring more of that smooth tomato sauce, spicy salami, mozzarella, and basil. 
"
354,"That you have to wander the aisles of a supermarket in search of the entrance merely adds to the feeling that you have the code to something secret, something special, something exclusive. Some two and a half hours later you leave this stunning restaurant feeling joyously replete but also with some regret that it’s all over.There are tables around the edge of the attractive room but sitting at the walnut counter watching the focused and practiced movements of the team is an integral part of the experience. Everyone is served at the same time by a smart black-suited team who prove that when service is really good, you barely notice it.Chef César Ramirez’s cooking is an almost subtractive form of cuisine, with the emphasis on allowing the natural flavors of ingredients to come through. The 13 or so small but perfectly formed dishes confirm a chef at the height of his powers as there is nothing showy or extraneous here. It’s just an absolute meticulousness in ensuring that the key ingredient, whether that’s a Scottish langoustine or A5 Wagyu beef from Miyazaki, delivers its true essence. The sauces, which are of extraordinary depth, play their part in this.
"
355,"This bright, airy dining room doubles as a flower shop, and its vivid, spring-like décor feels like stepping into a Real Simple magazine cover. But these gorgeous blooms serve a third, even more exciting, role at Il Fiorista, making their way into cocktails and dishes crafted with edible flowers like nasturtium blossoms and hibiscus petals.The results are deliciously unique. Owners Alessandra and Mario De Benedetti, who relocated from Italy, have expertly blended their homeland's sensibility with Executive Chef Rae Kramer’s culinary style. A beautifully-executed squid ink pasta, anelli al nero, is studded with tender, briny calamari, chili, and fennel; while a roasted honeynut squash tart stays seasonal with chestnut purée and shaved black truffle.

356,"Nothing says “Brit” like a billiards room and there’s one to be enjoyed at this swanky dining room of the New York Edition hotel—a collaboration between restaurateur Stephen Starr and British chef, Jason Atherton. The space, typically full to the brim, showcases a refined decorative style, with high ceilings, handsome wood-paneling, and every inch of wall space covered with framed pictures of the good and great.There’s an elevated and contemporary British accent to the menu too. Their version of fish and chips takes the national treasure to a new level with English peas and triple-cooked chips. Next up, a chutney made from plum and shallots served with roasted Long Island duck and woodsy chanterelles. The bronzed apple tarte Tatin is perfect for a pair. 
"
357,"Enjoyable and quietly elegant, Novitá boasts a genuine Italian sensibility both in setting and service. The small size and low ceilings foster a surprisingly serene ambience that is all but disappearing in the city. Prices are not cheap, but the quality is high. The cooking does not necessarily break new ground, but is nonetheless good. Rather than explore the costlier dishes that perhaps feature Kobe beef or black truffles, it’s best to stick to the tried-and-true favorites.Start with a superb combination of pan-fried shiitake caps filled with shrimp and scallions. Then, move on to tiny orecchiette mingled with just the right amount of slow-cooked and fiery lamb ragù, broccoli rabe and grated cheese. The espresso-soaked tiramisu is a perfect pick-me-up.
"
358,"This fresh concept from Ravi DeRossi and Overthrow Hospitality brings Chef Amira Gharib to the helm, with Drew Brady as wine director. The name is derived from Italy's tradition of hand-crafted sodas, and its spirit from USA's turbulent Prohibition era. Pass the entry sign to arrive at this mini haven, replete with a mighty vintage vibe—think velvet chairs, gleaming copper accents and stained glass lamps.On the menu, house-made pastas are a focus. There are also natural wines to accompany the seasonal, deftly executed vegan dishes. Toasted focaccia served in a miso bagna cauda is an umami-rich bite, tailed by tagliatelle tossed with nori ""butter"" sauce and broccoli rabe. Date cake with vanilla ""gelato"" gets a hit of black salt for delicious complexity.-
"
359,"This modern and elegant dining room displays the virtues of symmetry, with not so much as a single chair pushed out of its proper place. Everything is custom made, from the staff’s sharp suits to the handblown water vases. It's all evidence of Chef Daniel Humm’s masterful precision that extends through the cuisine as it artfully unfolds before each guest.The kitchen has a signature way with delicate presentations; and the menu beams with pristine ingredients that are handled with impressive creativity. Courses are so well conceived that they often seem as continuations of the same dish; specialties tend to reflect a flair for the dramatic that suit this luxurious room. The pastry team further enhances your dining experience by making sure that every meal ends on a high note.Cocktails are a must and the beverage program has featured expertly crafted drinks, highlighting a range of botanicals, including green tomato, yuzu, and sesame.
"
360,"If the Eastern European intelligentsia needed somewhere to plan a revolution or maybe just talk politics, they would meet here. Walls papered with Cyrillic newspapers set an appealingly covert scene, yet overall, the effect is inviting.The menu highlights Serbian fare that is hard to find in Manhattan. That said, some specialties will seem familiar, like zeljanica, a buttery wedge of classic phyllo pie folded with chopped spinach, garlic, herbs and feta. Unique dishes feature dried prunes stuffed with crumbly cheese, rolled in chicken liver and bacon; as well as the hearty and flavorful bean stew garnished with bits of tender pork ribs. Ćevapi is the catchall for sausages from the same area and here they highlight finely ground pork with herbs.
"
361,"Named for a racehorse and just as focused and quick, Speedy Romeo is in for a successful run. Part tavern, part roadside grill, its kitschy décor and modern touches transform this former automotive shop into a surprisingly attractive spot.The owner benefited from years at Jean-Georges’ empire, and that intelligence and experience is conveyed through the smart accents and whimsical menu that begins with Italian ingredients. Look to the wood-burning oven for smoky, meaty artichoke halves topped with lemon aïoli, sourdough crumbs, mint and peppery arugula. Take a chance on the non-traditional but utterly fantastic pizza combinations, such as the St. Louis, layering a proper crust with meats, pickled chillies and Midwestern Provel cheese.
"
362,"One bite makes it clear that this kitchen boasts a skilled chef and owner—Emanuel Concas. His menu—which reads like a proper lesson in regional Italian cooking—and list of aperitivos has been known to sate many a palate. Pastas are made in-house and may include cannelloni al forno with béchamel, parmigiano and short rib ragú. Then indulge in wood-fired delicacies that prove the chef’s Sardinian roots, like bottarga di muggine di Cabras liberally shaved over pici; or seadas, featuring a fritter filled with pecorino and topped with honey. Seal your meal with a springtime treat, like pastiera napoletana, composed with egg, ricotta, vanilla and citrus.Take a moment to appreciate the olive oil at the heart of this food and pick up a bottle or two to go.
"
363,"Italian hospitality with a Pugliese accent is on display at Mercato, a rustic trattoria in the western midtown hinterlands. The space is country-chic, with distressed wood tables, soft, exposed bulbs and vintage signs. The atmosphere is inviting and the menu is inspired by the classic dishes of Puglia, the birthplace of owner Fabio Camardi.First get a drink in your hand, then start with fave e cicoria, a straightforward purée of fava beans and garlicky chicory greens. A well-rounded Italian meal must have pasta, so be sure to indulge in the likes of orecchiette with broccoli rabe and garlic, enhanced by anchovies and breadcrumbs. For something deeply satisfying, try the fennel-dusted porchetta with a hearty side of potato and green cabbage mash.
"
364,"Perfectly East Village in scale, this intimate and ambitious bistro named after owner Reed Adelson's mother is composed of two slender rooms. These are unified by butterscotch-colored banquettes and whitewashed brick walls hung with vintage menus. Fine stemware and items presented on wooden boards lend an upscale manner to the experience.The kitchen takes risks while building upon a steady foundation of timeless classics. A crostino of fava bean tapenade and shredded squash is a wonderful seasonal treat—best paired with an icy glass of rosé. Dry-aged and perfectly seasoned duck with maitake mushrooms and cherries is sauced with a vibrant pea pureé, while baby carrots arranged with a taste of sumac and feta offer a light but bright finish.
"
365,"Tucked behind the Franklin Avenue subway stairs, this intimate Mediterranean venue has been causing quite a stir. A pretty slate-blue façade directs you to a small space starring whitewashed brick walls, blonde wood tables and a skylight. A handful of seats at the marble counter offer a view into the mini kitchen. But, there is nothing mini about Chef Nick Perkins’ culinary skills. In fact, he is the master of working magic out of a small kitchen.Start with an heirloom tomato salad laced with olive oil, dried red chili, and paired with escabeche-style mussels. Then perfectly poached hake is served with anchovies and bitter greens for a rustic yet relishable dish. Pork Milanese plated with cucumber and shaved fennel flaunts a great deal of fun and flair.
"
366,"The stars must have aligned to bring restaurateur Stephen Starr and design firm Roman and Williams together to form this bright culinary retreat settled along 26th Street. Everything seems to click at Upland—the setting is urbane and cozy, with vintage floors along with glowing jars of preserved lemons and backlit wine bottles lining the walls. Earthy and bountiful, it is an ideal backdrop for the California-meets-Mediterranean cooking. A meal from Chef Angelica Ampil and team might reveal a disc of hand-cut beef tartare with smoked egg yolk and pickled green tomatoes; or a tranche of roasted King salmon with tender-braised baby artichokes, smoked mussels, and pole beans.Yuzu soufflé with calamansi curd makes for a crowning finish.
"
367,"With ties to Seoul’s long-established Samwon Garden, founded in 1976, this Midtown hangout now operates under a different name. Nevertheless, it continues to deliver a reliable roster of barbecue hits. The restaurant stands tall with three floors, each one humming with constant K-Pop; and regardless of your perch, know that the quality of cooking and level of service rise well above other stalwarts in this fabled part of town.The signature Antoya galbi arrives lightly scored and delicately marinated, cooked on a tableside, gas-powered grill that never once threatens to choke the room in smoke. One could also make a meal out of the vibrant banchan, though fluffy egg soufflés and crunchy mung bean pancakes are lovely additions.
"
368,"Together with his wife, Ellia, Chef Junghyun Park wows diners from start to finish at this Gramercy hot spot with their unapologetic passion for Korean food. The fact that they eschew any kind of city pretense in favor of a deeply welcoming atmosphere simply adds to the allure.The space, which leans grungy-chic, was recently refurbished to feature rustic floors, communal tables, and singular artwork. The menu woos locals, visitors, and foodies alike with its adventurous—yet approachable—take on Korean cooking. Here you may find the likes of braised eggplant with snow crab and tomato; or crispy fried chicken brined in pineapple juice, coated with tempura batter, and served with a ginger-peanut butter sauce.
"
369,"Say good morning (or good afternoon) to the café of your dreams, for this tiny corner spot isn’t just another stop for an iced latte or a shot of double espresso. With a kitchen so small one could perhaps cook and wash dishes at the same time, and yet, these owners have high ambitions. That much is clear as soon as you enter and smell the sizzling tortillas.Corn here takes on several incarnations. Triangle-shaped tetelas are stuffed with black beans and wrapped in hoja santa leaves; while tlayuditas are toppled with hen of the wood mushrooms and salsa macha. A taco special might uncover avocado, salsa verde, and a runny egg. Items are an ode to the heirloom corn sourced from various villages in Mexico, and every one of them is worth waking up for.
"
370,"Named for an Ayurvedic herb that aids digestion, Pippali offers a pleasing study on the regional cuisines of India with its carte of sensational curries and other items. Canisters of the eponymous herb lining the walls, ace service, and sultry lighting make it great for date night or dinner with friends. A muted color scheme in the sleek dining room provides an ideal backdrop for the kitchen’s riot of boldly seasoned dishes.Standards are done right here, but focus on South Indian specialties for a unique perspective. Melagu chemeen—black pepper-rubbed Chilean sea bass in a coconut-red chili curry—along with coconut crab curry, dosas and uttapams. Platings are unfussy, as seen in the baingan ka salan with peanut, sesame, and of course, a myriad of spices.
"
371,"The idea that tasting menus are typically hours-long, showy, and cost a fortune is far from the norm at this shoebox of a spot. While the vibe inside is boisterous, the crowds are happy, chatty, and clearly delighted to be here. Service is friendly and rather like a well-oiled machine, churning out courses that come out like clockwork.The main dining room is arranged with walnut tables, gray leather chairs and brass globe light fixtures. However, the open kitchen—with its black-tile backsplash and granite countertop—is the obvious centerpiece. From here, a young team blitzes out an array of impressive grilled and skewered bites, meant to be eaten with your hands—Kochi is Korean for skewer, after all.Kudos to Chef Sungchul Shim, who taps into his Korean roots and fine-dining pedigree to create a solid but playful and technically proficient menu. Start with pine nut- and potato milk-soup, or sweet potato-and-sunchoke gratin, paired with a clever doenjang béchamel. Salmon bibimbap mingles pollock roe, candied anchovy, and toasted nori with brown soy-butter rice for a harmonious high point. The final hurrah? A stick of rich and nutty black sesame ice cream. Worth the splurge, you ask? Without a doubt.
"
372,"The spirit of this place has a casual, don't-mind-if-I-do vibe. Despite the laid-back ambience, reservations are advisable since tables fill early. Like the space, the well-edited menu is designed for sharing. Start with the daily spread—a parade of numerous dips, like smoky baba ganoush, lemony hummus, charred cabbage, spinach and artichoke dip and even a cauliflower-based riff on tabbouleh—all served with traditional lafta. Main dishes, from short rib and chicken to grilled octopus are rounded out with a litany of sides—the octopus is sided by a fava bean stew and a delicious rice and green lentil dish. Even the cocktails—available in large bottles for the table—get in on the sharing game.  
"
373,"At Dons Bogam, the food is fantastic and service indulgent. From the festive bar up front right down to those two-tops sporting blazing grills, every seat is filled, so reserve ahead. Make no mistake: this is no average K-town joint. Inside, a top-notch venting system lets diners enjoy a smoke-free evening of exceptional grilled meats. Start with fried pork mandu, which are on-point and divine. Pork belly marinated in red wine is smoky and supremely tender, but for the ultimate payoff, opt for the beef platter. It features thinly sliced maeun and yangnyeom galbi set beside meaty king trumpet mushrooms.In Midtown for meetings? Pop in for the BBQ lunch, a fun and interactive midday meal that is leaps above a quick grab-and-go salad, yet just as healthy. 
"
374,"It’s not just carnivores who’ll appreciate this most classic of steakhouses; Anglophiles, social historians, Scotch lovers and pipe smokers will also find themselves reveling in the immeasurably appealing atmosphere of Keens and its palpable sense of times past. Established in 1885, this midtown marvel suggests a Dickensian Gentleman’s club, with its dark wood paneling and low ceiling lined with thousands of clay pipes, although these days the customers are mostly deal-making business types rather than extravagantly whiskered thespians.Follow their lead and drape your jacket over the back of your chair, roll up your sleeves and attempt to gain control over a Porterhouse steak, dry-aged in-house, or finish their legendary mutton chop in one sitting.
"
375,"A dramatic space in a former warehouse is made even more theatrical by clever lighting: the darkness of the dining room is juxtaposed with the brightness of the open kitchen, which sits on one side of the room like a stage, but your eyes will be drawn inexorably towards the white-jacketed chefs as they go about their work with quiet efficiency. Eating here is serious business, but happily the place isn’t blighted by a monastic atmosphere—a contented buzz fills the room, helped along by the chefs who deliver the dishes themselves and describe them with contagious enthusiasm.A warm ""consomme"" poured over Oscietra caviar and roasted new potatoes emits sweet and flavorful notes. Then poached trout over curds is boosted with salted white currants, lichen, and birch; while a coin of sourdough is enriched by smoked trout belly, roe, and preserved truffle. Ice cream made from bedstraw, caramel made from meadowsweet, and an elegant presentation of ""confections"" further epitomize this new Nordic cuisine that celebrates man’s relationship with nature and the changing seasons. It’s clever without being self-congratulatory, original without being gimmicky and complex without being complicated.
"
376,"Turkish Kitchen showcases all the classics but excels in the preparation of grilled meats. Indulge in yoğurtlu karışık, a dish of moist and smoky char-grilled lamb, chicken and spicy kebabs on a cooling bed of garlic-scented yogurt and pita bread. Pillowy beef dumplings also wade in a pool of that signature sauce topped with paprika-infused oil as well as a dusting of sumac, oregano and mint. A wide selection of Turkish wines makes a fine accompaniment to a hearty meal.Dangling globe light fixtures give the entrance to this cavernous, multilevel restaurant with floor-to-ceiling windows a modern glow. Tables are topped with pristine white linen and set between black and white striped chairs; cherry-red walls lend a pop of color.
"
377,"Mari, which means “roll” in Korean, is Hell’s Kitchen’s latest destination from the talented Sungchul Shim, who made a name for himself at his tasting counter (Kochi) just down the street. Those familiar with casual Japanese handroll counters are in for a surprise as Chef Shim reimagines the genre as a tasting menu, primed with top-notch ingredients and Korean flavors.Glistening planks of Ora King salmon; tender strips of cured mackerel; and melting slabs of pork belly marinated with ssamjang are placed on beds of rice cradled in seaweed. Chefs work swiftly, moving from one roll to the next with nowhere to hide in this kitchen, flanked by counter seats on all sides. A bowl of warm bone broth with pork belly and noodles closes out the generous progression.
"
378,"Leave it to this Tokyo-based ramen chain to offer one of the city’s best bowls. A refined tonkatsu is the house favorite but the smoked dashi ramen holds its own. All noodles are made in-house and boast proper spring and bounce. Starters also flaunt refinement, including the crisp-seared gyoza packed with pork, ginger, and set in a cast-iron pan sizzling with ramen broth. For something lighter but equally heartwarming, go for the kale salad dressed with an umami-packed vinaigrette and garnished with sweet pomegranate and grapefruit segments. Finish with mango milk shaved ice topped with a dollop of honey cream.The décor is sleek, featuring high ceilings, concrete floors, and everything necessary to make it a slam-dunk among the midtown lunch crowds.
"
379,"Wolfgang’s is no stranger to the bustling New York steakhouse scene. From the lunch hour business crowd to the lively, post-work bar scene, this dining room jams in locals and tourists alike—each coming for the classic fare and precise Manhattans. The service can be gruff at times, but they have a good track record of squeezing you into a table or perch at the bar without a reservation.Once seated, the bone-in Porterhouse, cooked rare, is the only way to go. It arrives sizzling in its own fat, perfectly seasoned. Save space for a slice of bacon—a must-order appetizer—creamed spinach and crispy German potatoes with yet more salt and fat (at this point, why not?). Just beware: while dishes are sized to share, they’re priced like Maseratis.
"
380,"Native New Yorker Chef Chris Cipollone, who cut his teeth at some of the city's finest kitchens, makes a splash with Francie, which has taken up residence in a striking, limestone-clad building. Named for the main character in a Betty Smith novel, this quiet haven—featuring sleek ash wood floors with a center tile mosaic, exposed red brick walls, and widely spaced tables—is very elegant and rather unforgettable.The open kitchen is a true-to-life stage for this team, who can be seen prepping, cooking, and putting the finishing touches on a series of gratifying plates. To start, a soufflé cake topped with caviar-crested seaweed butter that's replete with umami flavor; or butternut squash bomboloni oozing with cheese and packed with pancetta. An earnest, delicate, and expert hand is clearly at work behind the pasta (rigatoni dressed with sweet and meaty Calabrian pumpkin and savory Italian sausage); while a flaky and golden pithivier filled with minced vegetables, lentils, and greens gets a masterful stroke of lush hazelnut curry.This regal repast may come full circle at dessert with a candied pecan-topped cream puff full of soft maple and strong Bourbon.
"
381,"Elegantly accessed by a sweeping staircase (or elevator) in the Langham hotel's lobby, Ai Fiori stands proudly above its Fifth Avenue address. This perfect perch for pretty ladies with their deal-making beaus in tow is dominated by walls of windows and espresso-dark wood. The handsome marble bar and lounge furnished with tufted banquettes sets an ideal scene for a post-work drink; while large florals, leather chairs and square columns lure families into the formal dining room.Service is attentive, the linens are thick, chargers are monogrammed with a goldleaf “F” and every last detail is very, very lovely. As one might expect of a Michael White restaurant, the menu boasts of Italian favorites mingled with contemporary flair. Pastas are masterful, so begin with thin spaghetti tossed in a chunky tomato sauce infused with garlic, scallion, spicy chili and sweet crabmeat. Fish courses can be even more enticing—try the Atlantic halibut crowned with yellow squash and purple radishes or a plate of aromatic bouillabaisse.Desserts too shine through, as seen in the velvety Paris-Brest. Light, frilly and deliciously creamy with choux pastry and hazelnut-praline, it's almost too pretty to eat.
"
382,"With all due respect to Monday through Saturday, the best day may be ""Sunday in Brooklyn."" In contrast to its rustic bar downstairs, this stalwart now boasts a second floor dining room, with palm trees and whitewashed walls. A breezy vibe, old-school tunes and stirring sips encourages lingering. Add that to the fact that all baking is done on-site, and it's no wonder this is such a bit hit. Following suit, begin with crusty sourdough and creamy beer butter or warm and sticky buns. The kitchen also excels in smoking fish and fermenting vegetables.Brunch and lunch are big, but the chef curries favor with diners all day long. A wallet-friendly Dark and Stormy can be a fine tonic against inclement weather. Don't miss the market for irresistible pastries.
"
383,"It doesn’t get more classic New York than this iconic Restaurant Row institution. Opened in 1906, Barbetta is a testament to proper dining out, where outerwear is mandatorily checked and servers waltz around good-looking guests as well as the hushed, gilded surrounds donning neatly pressed tuxedos. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the impossibly romantic patio has been the backdrop for countless marriage proposals.The kitchen’s Northern-influenced specialties are listed on thick cardstock, and each item is highlighted by the year of its addition to the menu. Linguine with pesto alla Genovese is as scrumptious today as it was in 1914; while luscious rabbit alla Piemontese, dating back to the Clinton era and braised in white wine and lemon, is equally divine.
"
384,"To think of these arancini as mere “rice balls” is a slight on Sicilian cuisine; they are so much more. Nowhere else in the city will you dine on such crisp, classic beauties—filled with ragù, peas, mozzarella and rice cooked in chicken stock, then presented in a pool of light tomato sauce. Rest assured though as the menu goes on to list other authentic and deliciously rendered items, including the 'rianata pizza of Trapani.The rustic space is filled with old, crackle-glazed platters that probably held the exact style of the rich anelletti al forno, back in the Old Country. Before you leave, stock up on specialty ingredients that are strategically displayed for sale. Wine bottles racked up along the walls hint at a lengthy and noteworthy selection.
"
385,"Tucked next to the steely skeleton of the Williamsburg Bridge, Meadowsweet cuts a stylish industrial figure with its glass-fronted façade, whitewashed brick walls and original mosaic-tiled floors. Leather banquettes line the wall, and pendant bulbs illuminate one of several beautiful oil paintings of a meadow. Inside, the restaurant jumps with Williamsburg’s finest—along with more than a few bridge-hoppers from Manhattan and beyond. And that’s on a slow night.The fuss is quite merited. Despite ample competition in this section of town, Chef/owner Polo Dobkin and wife, Stephanie Lempert, manage to elevate the kitchen’s dishes into next-level territory, and they do so in a lovely, urbane setting with loads of charm and friendly service.The inventive American menu gets a lift from Mediterranean accents: fried artichokes served with a tangle of bitter-spicy arugula in a creamy vinaigrette are positively addictive. Crisped black bass with a parsley root velouté sings with a side of green apple cabbage, which is flecked with chunks of smoky bacon. There’s an impressive list of cocktails and wine; not to mention a globetrotting beer selection ranging from Austrian lagers to Japanese ales.
"
386,"More than just an icon of the NY dining scene—Peter Luger is a veritable rite of passage. Run on wheels by a team of gloriously forthright waiters, this munificent paean to beef doesn’t just serve legendary steaks, it provides a side helping of history too. The wood paneling and beer-hall tables tell of family gatherings, friends united, deal making, success celebrated and stories swapped. It’s evocative and unforgettable. It’s also unapologetically old-school—computerization and credit cards remain fanciful futuristic concepts, so you’ll need to come with a few Benjamins tucked into your wallet.Start with a thick slice of bacon to get your taste buds up to speed before the steak arrives. These slabs of finely marbled Porterhouse are dry-aged in-house for around 28 days, which means there’s tenderloin on one side of the bone and strip steak on the other. They are then broiled to perfection, sliced before being brought to the table, and served with their own sauce as well as a host of sides, which range from their version of German fried potatoes to creamed spinach.If you can still feel a pulse, go ahead and order dessert, if only to get a mound of their famous schlag made in the back.
"
387,"Taboon’s namesake brick-walled, wood-fired oven is burning a bit brighter these days since Chef Efi Nahon has returned to Hell’s Kitchen’s finest Middle Eastern dining room. That oven not only provides a heartwarming welcome and sets the whitewashed interior aglow, but it is also responsible for baking an incredible plank of bread that is alone worth a trip here.Bring friends because this midtown marvel’s menu is best enjoyed by grazing the list of zesty meze like house-made scallop and crab sausage shakshuka with poached quail egg, or a wild mushroom bread pudding with creamy taleggio and romesco. Vegetables aren’t spared the flames either, as evident in a luscious and healthy pile of roasted broccolini splashed with orange oil.
"
388,"While the décor may be more deli-meets-deco and there’s a tad less attitude, this food is every bit as good as it was on Second Avenue. Ignore the kvetching and know that this is a true Jewish deli filled with personality, and one of the best around by far.The menu remains as it should: kosher, meat-loving and non-dairy with phenomenal pastrami, pillowy rye, tangy mustard, perfect potato pancakes and fluffy matzo balls in a comforting broth. Have the best of both worlds with the soup and half-sandwich combination.Carve a nook during midday rush, when in pour those crowds. The deli also does takeout (popular with the midtown lunch bunch), and delivery (grandma’s latkes at your door). Giant platters go equally well to a bris or brunch.
"
389,"Fresh, soft-ripened, pressed, washed or blue—no matter what kind of cheese you prefer, Casellula is sure to have it. Better still, take advantage of their helpful tasting notes and try something brand new. Cheeses arrive with creative pairings like pickled fennel, lemon-zested hazelnuts and maybe even a glass of something from their vast wine list. Round out your meal with small plates of crostini or perhaps a hearty sandwich. For dessert, sweet potato cake is topped with brown sugar sauce and served with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream for just the right amount of sweetness.The cozy dining room is warm with flickering candles, wood tables and a delightful staff. It’s also small and fills up quickly, so parties of two should make a reservation.
"
390,"Even in Tokyo’s smart Ginza district, sushiyas tend to be discreet little places but there’s no such modesty here in midtown. In fact, this branch of the international chain has gone full-on Fifth Avenue, where even the ceiling is of cathedral-like proportions. The 16-seater cypress counter is the focus of the room and offers a luxe sushi experience—not unlike the staff who makes everyone feel special from start to finish.Here, particularly at lunch, you’ll find several Japanophiles satisfying their cravings by ordering ten or more pieces of nigiri before scurrying back to their offices. Some of the chefs are more engaging than others, but all work with the same practiced, fluid movements. At dinner, the omakase is a significant affair—reflected in the prices—where the itamae demonstrate their mastery over different seasonal fish. The koshihikari rice is yuki-tsubaki from the Niigata Prefecture and is seasoned with red vinegar, which makes it quite dark in color. Each piece is simply brushed with nikiri and occasionally some grated yuzu, but on the whole this is about enjoying natural flavors.The impressive selection of nihonshu, presented on an iPad, includes many small producers.

391,"Don Antonio’s knows its way around a pie. The namesake outpost, located in Naples, has been running strong since 1901. If that isn’t enough street cred to send you running to this beloved midtown pizzeria, then the generous buzz surrounding Roberto Caporuscio’s other NY venture, Kesté, will do the trick. This kitchen's signature is the Montanara Starita—a lightly fried pizza laced with house-made tomato sauce, smoked mozzarella and basil, then finished in the wood-fired oven. But really, who could stop there with treasures like the salsiccia e friarielli pizza to sample, highlighting crumbled fennel sausage, smoked mozzarella, rapini greens and a swirl of EVOO.Filled with unique Sicilian varietals, this wine list is more thoughtful than it needs to be.
"
392,"Featuring a manifold of rooms including a sunken area with close-quartered tables and a mezzanine with gold leaf walls, it is Tori Shin’s enclosed counter that retains the X factor. Packed with a mix of expense account crowds and casual walk-ins, this labyrinth of a restaurant exudes a lively energy, as does its chefs who can be seen fanning charcoal over a sizzling grill. What emerges is a host of skewers best ordered as part of the omakase.The kitchen’s focus is on such organically raised chicken parts as tenderloin with wasabi; boneless thighs with bell peppers; and smoky ribs with yuzu kosho. This worthy progression is then tailed by seaweed-seasoned sushi rice for a harmonizing feast. Shiso ice cream makes a fine denouement.
"
393,"Chef Daniel Boulud’s midtown canteen is fashioned by Jeffrey Beers and dons a contemporary demeanor. The front lounge is abuzz with post-work and pre-theater gaggles, while well-behaved crowds in the back are seated in a walnut-paneled space dressed with mirrors and black-and-white photography.Like its setting, the menu is inventive and unites classic bistro cooking with market-inspired creations. That lush pâté en croûte is a buttery pastry encasing layers of creamy country pâté, guinea hen and foie gras, dressed with huckleberry compote, toasted pine nuts and pickled enoki mushrooms. Wild rice-crusted fluke presented with Hawaiian blue prawn and sauce Américaine further demonstrates the kitchen’s contemporary leanings.
"
394,"Thanks to the trademark style of Chef Jason Marcus, this lovely Mexican favorite draws those chill, relaxed Williamsburg crowds into its slender space. Everything seems to glow beneath etched brass ceiling pendants, as servers carefully place course after well-paced course on those tiny tables.A delicious alchemy is at work here, as evidenced by the remarkably delicate corn flan tamal, topped with buttery roasted corn, set over garlic-poblano cream and tucked with pickled trumpet mushrooms. Tacos are also absolute standouts, thanks to soft, warm tortillas folded with roasted bone marrow, chorizo marmalade and charred lime. Like the menu, the beverage listing is loads of fun, with wines whimsically arranged under headings of iconic women.
"
395,"For flavorful Turkish food infused with contemporary influence, Pera serves to please. Lunch does big business in this attractive dining room, layered in a chocolate-brown color scheme and packed with corporate types as well as visitors looking for a sleek place to sojourn mid-day. Acoustics can be loud, but with food so fine, you’ll want to stay awhile.Dinner is more low-key but the menu always brims with simple, good quality and slightly renovated plates like warm hummus with pastirma; lentil and bulgur tartare; or watermelon chunks tossed with salty feta, tomatoes and olive oil. A forkful of their model and deliciously tender chicken adana with a side of addictively crispy fries has wide appeal and makes for a fitting feast—at all times.

396,"Kajitsu is a detailed study in subtlety. Serving shojin cuisine based on the precepts of Buddhism, this traditionally decorated  space is a second-floor sanctuary of peace. Inside, it offers table or counter seating; and service that is as charming as it is earnest.Such is the skill of this kitchen that you’ll forget in no time about the absence of fish or meat. It’s all about balance, harmony, and simplicity—and allowing the ingredients’ natural flavors to shine, whether that's the miso soup served with burdock root rice or spring roll filled with new harvest potato and fava beans. Your period of contemplation may come to a juddering halt when you find yourself back on Lexington, but for a few moments at least, you’ll feel you connected with nature.
"
397,"A multi-million dollar renovation hasn’t glossed over any of Gallagher’s iconic character. Walls covered with photos of horses and jockeys harken back to the seasoned stallion’s former proximity to the old Madison Square Garden. The menu’s “other soup” is a sly reference held over from Prohibition days; and diners still walk past the window-fronted meat locker where slabs of USDA Prime beef are dry-aged.Gallagher’s fresh sparkle is exhibited by the display kitchen, set behind glass panes. The chefs here turn out contemporary-minded fare like hamachi crudo with a yuzu-jalapeño vinaigrette to go with choice cuts of meat grilled over hickory. The rib steak is a bone-in ribeye that arrives mouthwateringly tender with a side of warm and savory house sauce.
"
398,"This luxe fine dining operation, with a classically old-school moniker, resides in the one of the city's newest skyscrapers. Chef Daniel Boulud has done it again, fashioning a room that makes the well-heeled feel right at home. Plate glass and soaring ceilings are softened by a warm palette and greenery throughout. The bar, a prized perch, is a glossy, dark stone affair ringed by sleek seats and crowned by a dramatic blown glass chandelier.The kitchen skillfully prepares a contemporary, globally inflected carte dominated by seafood and vegetable-focused items. Recent highlights included torchetti pasta with Maryland jumbo lump crabmeat and a flourish of heirloom sweet peppers; or the amber-skinned rotisserie chicken breast with a root vegetable pot pie.
"
399,"This inspired little South Williamsburg spot finds its culinary niche in mixing Japanese and Ashkenazi Jewish fare. Not all the dishes are a fusion of the two styles, but many—like the matzoh ball ramen or the terrific lox bowl stuffed with avocado, Japanese pickles and sushi rice—cleverly straddle both cuisines.Kick things off with perfectly presented toro tartare over house-baked sake kasu challah, spread with scallion cream cheese and topped with “everything” spice; or deliciously tender teriyaki duck wings, a duo of drumsticks glazed to sweet-and-salty perfection and finished with a flutter of scallions and pickled ginger. For dessert, the chocolate-banana challah bread pudding with whipped crème fraîche and whiskey caramel, is a worthy splurge.
"
400,"Encounter large smiles and a particularly warm and welcoming vibe as you enter this chic and convivial wine-focused establishment. While it may be located on a relatively quiet strip, don't be fooled as there is a palpable buzz within. This is largely thanks to the culinary expertise and creativity of Chef Nick Curtola as well as the celebrity cachet of owner James Murphy (LCD Soundsystem).Inside, the décor is as minimalist as their succinct menu. Start with chicken liver mousse or the stalwart yellowfin tuna dressed tonnato-style and made bright with yuzu kosho. Montauk scallops cured in a vibrant leche de tigre have a fantastic Thai bent enhanced with the earthy edge of thinly sliced kohlrabi. Just like cultured butter is a perfect companion to their warm house-made bread, slices of sweet Bosc pear and salt-baked onion augment beautifully crisped and properly rendered Long Island duck. Let the sociable staff talk you into closing over a quince-and-frangipane tart with citrus-whipped cream.This neighborhood gem is laser focused when it comes to wine varietals, so if their wide-ranging, impressive selection has you atwitter, fret not; it also features half-glasses for abundant sampling.
"
401,"If anything indicates the strength of New York City’s Japanese restaurants, it is the growing number of authentic establishments that seem like they could be sitting just as happily in Ginza as they do in midtown Manhattan.Tempura Matsui is such a place, as it skillfully demonstrates why tempura is a celebrated Japanese cuisine type in its own right. Of course, the prized seats are at the counter, especially if you want to see this master at work.The chef uses a mix of sesame and cottonseed oils; and the gently bubbling pot is refreshed and replenished regularly. Equally important, the batter is used sparingly so that the ingredients taste truly of themselves. You’ll start with a parade of seasonal dishes including tofu with uni, before having some beautifully arranged sashimi. It is then time for the main event, which begins in the traditional way with crispy shrimp legs. The ingredients and fish turned out of this kitchen usually vary according to the seasons, but could include the likes of wonderfully tender squid, succulent Hokkaido scallop, plump matsutake, as well as subtly sweet onion. And be sure to end with tencha, with its mellow, delicious and deeply flavorful broth.
"
402,"Step through this buffed metal doorway to find an oenophile’s fantasy where Zalto stemware is stacked high and each polished glass is ready to be filled by one of the 200 selections brilliantly curated by Le Bernardin’s super-star sommelier, Aldo Sohm. Over 40 wines on the list are offered by the glass.A tailored crowd sits and sips—perhaps on an oversized U-shaped sofa, at a comfy counter or at one of a handful of tall tables. The scene is luxe but also comfortable, featuring crystal fixtures and a stylish array of bric-a-brac stacked high to the soaring ceiling. Tapas-sized snacks are designed for sharing with wine consumption in mind and include a plate of cheeses, charcuterie, harissa-roasted carrots or chicken drumstick prepared coq au vin-style.
"
403,"This tantalizing spot nestled into a renovated garage arrived with the barbecue boom that hit the city in the early aughts, when serious chefs started taking excellent cuts of meat and giving it the smoker treatment. Today, it is still one of the best in the game, with a casual, hangout vibe, where you order cafeteria-style; then eat your goodies on butcher paper-lined trays at long, communal picnic tables. Sauce bottles, including an addictive and delicious Carolina mustard version, are peppered throughout the room. The focused menu offers exceptional pulled pork, brisket, and dry-rubbed ribs. Sides like German potato salad and broccoli salad are just as delightful.The bar features a solid lineup of small batch American spirits and local draft beers.
"
404,"In contrast to its reputation, this hip and popular rookie sits on a quiet corner of Kent Avenue. Steps away from the waterfront, it isn't as beloved for its views as it is for its uplifting vibe, set by Owners Ria Graham and husband, Kevol. This is cooking that pans the Caribbean and the kitchen team infuses it with unique twists. Yard-long flatbreads, like the rasta pasta, are a favorite, thanks to the presence of shrimp, Jamaican callaloo, and plantain. Other hits include the vegetarian whole-roasted cauliflower in cashew sauce seasoned with allspice. Fish tacos and braised oxtail will leave you wanting for more.Weather permitting, sit outside, groove to the DJ's beats, and devour a Kokolada pineapple rum cake. Sound like bliss? It is.
"
405,"This gem stands out for its keen understanding and delicious rendering of Vietnamese cuisine, which is rather rare in these parts. Shelves of market goodies lure passersby into the cool, contemporary space, fitted out with a central open kitchen, two vast dining areas, and a cozy backyard.The kitchen team straddles the line between subtle and savory with ease and creativity. Follow the example of a Vietnamese rice tamale filled with shrimp, chilies, and pork cracklings for a compelling bite. Fried shrimp toast with jackfruit, lime juice, and fennel fronds is a flavor bomb; while crêpes stuffed with maitake mushrooms and duck prosciutto are amplified by fish sauce. The lavish spread comes a full circle with sesame brittle atop sweet corn tapioca pudding.
"
406,"It might be easy for Klein's to mail it in being that it's on the bottom floor of the stylish Hoxton Hotel. But, despite its ultra-chic, vintage-luxe setting—with sky-high exposed brick walls and an open kitchen lined with stools for chef-gawking and drinking—it manages to infuse its diverse fare with devoted care and attention. Service is helpful and although there is a hefty sprinkling of locals, the vibe is celebratory.Dinner might begin with warm tortilla chips and a savory avocado dip with feta and spiced pepitas. Mains may unveil a double-decker chicken sandwich with cool cucumber, dill yogurt, and hot sauce—as well as a side of irresistible fries. The refreshing Summer Daze (Tequila Altos, pineapple, lime, and tajin salt) hits all the right spots.
"
407,"There is a spartan appearance to this sushi temple, where honey-toned bamboo slats are by far the warmest decorative feature. Reservations require confirmation and punctuality, but to sushi-loving diehards, this is just the cost of admission.Avoid the tables packed with suits (this is midtown, after all) and request a seat at the sleek counter—it’s where the magic happens. Your experience here depends entirely on the soft-spoken, attentive and very focused itamae working before you, as his signature style will guide your meal. Their mission is to ensure that each diner receives a wide variety of fish that has just been cut, formed and dressed moments before it is eaten.The kitchen lives up to its hype by ignoring new wave trends in favor of serving classically assembled and spectacularly pristine sushi. Every item is handled with the utmost care, especially the progression of sashimi highlighting the ample textures of mackerel, tuna and salmon. Outstanding clams and scallops are seasoned with a touch of lemon and sea salt flakes to enhance their natural taste; while nigiri featuring Maine and Japanese uni tastings underscore the subtle differences in flavor.
"
408,"To taste what may be the continent’s best sushi, experience the quiet, contemplative and very exclusive ceremony of Chef Masa Takayama’s omakase. Everything here carries a certain weight, beginning with the heavy wooden door and carrying through to the bill. The room of course is as unchanging and calming as a river stone, set amid blonde hinoki wood and a gargantuan forsythia tree. Yes, you’ll forget it’s on the fourth floor of a mall.Attention to detail is unsurpassed and at times it may seem like a bit much, but a reverential spirit is part of your meal here. Service displays the same smooth grace, with servers at-the-ready carrying their hot towels, fingerbowls, tea and bits of insight.Awaken the palate with a sweet chunk of hairy crab meat dressed in citrusy yuzu beneath creamy tomalley. This may be followed by the chef’s signature glass coupe of minced toro and a very fine—and very generous—pile of Osetra caviar. Maine uni is downright wondrous, served in its shell with caramelized custard and paper-thin, melting sheets of white truffle. The chef’s selection of sushi is unrivaled; the rice is firm and temperate, garnishes are subtle, and quality of fish is supreme.
"
409,"This is a steakhouse in the moneyed Time Warner Center after all, so deals here are going down almost as quickly as those bottles of Château Margaux. Still, this isn’t a suits-only haunt; in fact, the intuitive service makes everyone feel like a bigwig. And the Central Park views are worthy of the price tag alone.The food is straightforward, featuring crab cakes with horseradish-mustard sauce and charred cowboy rib steak. But, don’t shy away from other equally surprising items, including sweet, slightly al dente corn bathed with a delightfully rich and creamy sauce. South Carolina coconut cake is one fluffy layer after another topped with a smooth and not-too-sweet icing as well as a heap of shaved coconut for just the right bit of crunch.
"
410,"It’s a jam-packed lunchtime operation here at Soba Totto, where business folks gather and quickly fill the popular space. As the name suggests, everyone arrives in droves for the tasty homemade soba. Dinnertime brings a mellower vibe, and a crowd of beer- and sake-sipping patrons ordering tasty plates of spicy fried chicken and yakitori galore.Midday features several varieties of lunch sets. Tasty appetizers may unveil a salad of assorted pickles and simmered daikon in a sweet ginger dressing. Skip over the fried seafood in favor of the soba totto gozen set, which includes the wonderful noodles in fragrant dashi; or try one of the many delicious dons topped with tasty tidbits like sea urchin and salmon roe or soy-marinated tuna, grated yam and egg.
"
411,"A shiny black awning marks the entrance to this slightly antiseptic yet considerably authentic sushi bar. A few rooms done in traditional Japanese style provide seating choices at this den, which hums with business groups on the run and neighborhood dwellers seeking fantastic value lunches as well as terrific quality sushi in the evening.Choose to dine at their beloved counter or at a table in the well-lit dining room, attended to by speedy servers. Then, dive in to generously sized lunch specials featuring perhaps a colorful chirashi, headlining yellowtail, salmon, tamago and amberjack set deftly over well-seasoned sushi rice. Sticky glazed eel, nicely grilled and plenty fatty, is an absolute must, as is the impressive omakase for dinner.
"
412,"After much anticipation, Le Crocodile threw open its doors and the crowds came pouring in for its fine French cuisine, executed with meticulous detail and care. This hip setting is largely composed of soaring ceilings, an array of windows, vibrant mosaic tile floors, and cast-iron columns. A spacious, verdant and breezy outdoor patio is yet another perch from where diners can savor the plates turned out by Chefs Aidan O’Neal and Jake Leiber.A plate of silken leeks comes together with a vinaigrette and toasted, crushed hazelnuts; while the chicken liver pâté with cornichons and a layer of berry fruit gelée is simple, luscious and classic to a tee. Tarte au citron is coddled with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and lemon zest for a rich and warming <i>finis</i>.
"
413,"The longevity of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s flagship can be due to many factors—a sumptuous setting, a discreet aura, and superior French cuisine. Like walking through Business on your way to First Class, you have to pass through buzzy Nougatine to get here. Low-slung chairs and large tables mean you need a certain confidence in your conversational delivery if you wish to entertain the whole table.Dishes showcase everything from attention to detail and impeccable products to thoughtful garnishes and nuanced flavors. The omnivore menu is also appealingly versatile thanks to contemporary accents and classic techniques. Picture charred beets with tamarind and saffron or buttery Wagyu with crispy potato and black truffle to get those taste buds going.
"
414,"There are three Indian Accents: New Delhi is the most glamorous and London the most intimate. New York however delivers the most bustle, but they all celebrate the increasing sophistication of this sub-continent’s cuisine by offering contemporary specialities and elevated street food from a number of regions in balanced, well thought out tasting menus. The clued-up staff knows their syllabus and offers sound recommendations.There are other similarities, not least in the fact that some dishes, like the ghee roast lamb with roti, appear in all three. The best items, however, are often those that could persuade you to take up vegetarianism full time, including the sweet potato shakarkandi or baby idlis that feature extra firepower courtesy of “gunpowder.”
"
415,"Two superstar chefs arrive in one package with the elegant Mifune and omakase bar, Sushi Amane, which is located downstairs. Chef Hiroki Yoshitake presents delicious, contemporary Japanese cuisine here at Mifune, in a space featuring cement walls, blonde wood and cozy backlighting.Alongside tempura, rice dishes, and other delightful entrées, this menu also offers a daily selection of sashimi. Tender smoked butterfish arrives with shaved radish rounds, nasturtium leaves and a bright chimichurri-like sauce made from garlic, herbs and oil. Then, grilled chicken Yuan-style appears in a mini cast-iron skillet, brushed with an irresistible teriyaki-based sauce, and paired with knobs of tender, buttery potatoes, snap peas and frizzled leeks.
"
416,"Call it a trip to Tokyo without the tariff—this sleek izakaya is tucked down a side street in bustling midtown. Once inside, grab a table for two or join the crowd at the open kitchen counter surrounding the smoky robata. The waiters talk up the omakase, but it’s worth letting your own instincts guide you on a personalized tour of their offerings.Dishes boast a great value, especially the lunch set, starring hamachi and salmon sashimi, miso- and soy-glazed cod, chilled cabbage and daikon, as well as grilled Washu beef. Sukiyaki is a seasonal special of beef served in a hot pot with tofu, vegetables and noodles. Other standbys include smoky bamboo shoots with bonito; and tsukune, a ground chicken meatball brushed with teriyaki and dipped in raw egg.
"
417,"If you’ve eaten at Mifune and wondered why you saw some customers with expectant grins being ushered downstairs, it’s because they were lucky enough to secure reservations at Sushi Amane.Behind the soft and silky wood counter, with seating for just eight, stands the confident figure of Chef Shion Uino. He looks young because he is young, but then again he started early and garnered over eight years’ experience at the highly garlanded Sushi Saito in Tokyo before setting sail for NYC. His experience is evident in the number of dishes served before the nigiri, which may include creamy uni from different regions of Japan; delicious hairy crab served in its shell; steamed scallop wrapped in nori; and tender abalone.When it comes to the nigiri, the chef also shares his alma mater’s attention to detail and insistence on consistency. Each piece is given just a light brush of nikiri so that the focus remains on its natural flavor, whether that’s the silvery kohada, luminous white squid or the golden anago. The rice, at slightly above body temperature, leaves a lasting impression. There are two seatings—at 6:00 and 8:30 PM—and as diners are served together it’s important to arrive on time.
"
418,"This Alain Ducasse bistro, housed in the venerable La Côte Basque space, may have been renovated in recent years, but it remains decidedly Old World in look, feel and taste. The setting remains a sight to behold, with its abundant framed mirrors, red velvet banquettes and oak paneled walls. In the front salon, two red wingback chairs are tilted in to face a working fireplace and make an idyllic spot for nibbling madeleines at the end of your meal.The unabashedly French menu is stacked with comfortable, familiar bistro dishes that feature the likes of cassoulet, pâté en croûte and foie de veau. Traditional desserts are a highlight, especially the crème caramel, flecked with vanilla beans and served in a generous pool of sauce.
"
419,"Set at the intersection off of a bustling area, an open and cavernous façade lures diners into this vast, multi-level space, donning four separate bars, a beer garden, rooftop, and a series of private rooms.At the head of the kitchen is NYC veteran, Chef John DeLucie and Erasmo Lassandro, both of whom employ the all-powerful wood-burning oven to churn out delectable pizzas and baked dishes. Free-range chicken under a brick is united with broccoli rabe and olive oil-mashed potatoes for a crisp, ultra-flavorful plate; while pizza boscaiola, with pancetta, mushrooms, and mozzarella exceeds every addictive expectation. Then, lasagna tucked with ragù Bolognese may be tailed by banana bread pudding to bring the feast to a sensational and comforting conclusion.
"
420,"The Modern is designed to capture the iconic feel of the MoMA in which it is housed. Art enthusiasts can't help but ogle at its glorious surrounds; while excellent acoustics facilitating quiet conversations ensure a steady stream of couples and globe-trotters. The kitchen is state of the art, so for a truly special experience book the chef's table inside. The staff perform a veritable ballet as they present diners with such appealingly nuanced dishes as a seed cracker with aged cheddar and butternut squash butter; or eggs on eggs, starring none other than soft-boiled eggs with sturgeon caviar. Turbot roasted on the bone may then arrive alongside rich parmesan cream.Nurse a digestif—and marvel at the timeless sculpture garden view —for serenity embodied.
"
421,"This leopard’s take on Italian dining favors elegance over rusticity. Set within two Beaux Arts townhouses (once home to a Rockefeller family member), the restaurant is an understated sprawl of ivory walls contrasted against dark-stained floors and smoky mirrors.The smartly attired staff attends to a buttoned-up crowd digging into pricey but pleasing fare like shaved artichoke salad with organic frisée, lemon, olive oil and bottarga di muggine.Here, a golden-brown and crisp-skinned baby chicken arrives split into two neat halves, simply grilled with rosemary and lemon, and served with roasted potatoes. And like everything else at Il Gattopardo, the cassata Siciliana—with its candied fruit and bright green almond paste—is a dressed-up take on the classic.
"
422,"La Grenouille is a bastion of old-world glamour, elegance. and manners—complete with an exorbitant budget for floral arrangements. Although this storied enclave still attracts a devoted following, there’s always room for locals, newbies and blinged-out tourists. Everyone looks good in this lavish dining room, where red velvet banquettes, polished wood veneer, and softly lit tables bathe the space with rose and apricot hues.Classic and classy, this is French cuisine worthy of high praise. Delicate ravioli is stuffed with chopped lobster hinting of tarragon and dressed with creamy, tart beurre blanc; while seared beef tenderloin arrives with foie gras and pommes souffles. For dessert, the île flottante is heaven under a cloud of spun caramel.
"
423,"A big and bright red wood-burning oven is not merely a visual centerpiece at 21 Greenpoint, it is also the soul of their thoroughly pleasing American fare. Similarly, the space oozes with that appealingly familiar feel, featuring plank floors, mosaics and disheveled walls. This is where those breads and pizze are baked, just as meats and root vegetables are roasted.It's hard to achieve this level of delicious, well-sourced cooking in hipster Williamsburg, but the menu excels in this regard. It also changes daily and is notably accommodating to both vegans and vegetarians. When offered, don’t miss their multi-course Sunday night prix-fixe, which may include a frittata, peppery pork shoulder soup with foraged mushrooms and much, much more.
"
424,"This is Daniel Boulud’s ode to the countries that line the Mediterranean coast—from France’s Côte d’Azur to Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon and beyond. Packed and lively, the handsome room features vaulted ceilings, striped banquettes and a humming semi-open kitchen.The menu is light and punctuated by bright ingredients, like lumache al pesto Genovese tossing haricots verts, Parmigiano Reggiano, and pignoli; as well as perfectly cooked Lone Mountain Wagyu enriched by summer squash, confit cherry tomatoes, and salsa verde. Thanks to Johana Langi, the talented pastry chef, diners are treated to such delightful bites as baklava, caramel-balsamic bonbon, and pistachio madeleines. And the famous grapefruit givré continues to live on as a dessert for the ages.
"
425,"Step through the serene, bamboo-filled entrance and into this dedicated sushi den. The mood is respectfully formal yet friendly, thanks to the focused kitchen staff who are happily interacting with guests. Just arrive with a sense of what (and how much) you’d like to eat and insist upon the omakase.Let the day’s catch dictate your meal and take a seat at the counter to ensure the best quality. The glassed-in display of fish and mollusks is the only thing that separates you from this team of skilled, disciplined chefs. While the omakase, set on a large wood platter for a vibrant and beautiful display, may be wildly varied depending on the day (and your chef), high standards are always maintained and each morsel is treated with integrity. 
"
426,"This clean façade, set upon a mundane artery beside the BQE, has just a noren to mark its entrance. Inside, it's all warmth, as servers lead diners into a space donning tufted banquettes, greenery galore, and framed articles. Udon is the focus of this kitchen—even at lunch, when the crowds are endless, but committed to sampling some of the best in town.The menu offers everything from simple edamame to a salad of greens, avocado, and seared octopus. But, indulge in the star of the show, offered in such varieties as cold seiro; zenryufun blended with wheat bran and germ; as well as sasauchi made from bamboo- and barley-leaf. If some of the items sound unfamiliar, let the passionate staff talk you into these bowls of delicious comfort.
"
427,"Named for Montreal's beloved hot dog shack, you will find this ultra-popular spot located on a windswept corner of Greenpoint. Aidan O’Neal and veteran NY’er Jake Leiber have made a name for themselves at this intimate little gem, which sports a meat-centric mentality along with a modern French-Canadian sensibility—potted meats anyone? Porky dishes and pâtés are part and parcel of this dining experience, so don't leave without tucking in to the pig’s head terrine. Lighter appetites can balance out such heavy leaning dishes with a roasted half-chicken accompanied by charred onions and set atop a bed of nutty and vibrant romesco.Desserts—including the chocolate flourless cake—are equally popular. But, it is brunch that warrants a queue of famished locals.
"
428,"Buttoned-up midtown gets a much-needed shot in the arm compliments of Chef Alex Stupak’s lively flagship from his popular Empellón family. This colorful and multi-level space offers a first floor outfitted with a generous bar area and prime view of the bustling open kitchen. On the mezzanine level, find a more intimate dining space.The menu bears the chef’s signature creative flair, offering a range of small bites, tacos and shareable large plates.

429,"Brought to you by Dennis Ngo, Kim Hoang and Tuan Bui, this Vietnamese bijou spot has been thriving as the cool kid on the block for  a while now. The façade and setting too have remained  unchanged—large white wood-framed windows and an inviting, evergreen patio. The menu further soothes the soul with well-known favorites, daily specials, and of course, an array of pho—also the star of the show. Wok-seared beef pho delights with tender sliced brisket, egg yolk, and rice noodles floating in an umami-packed bone broth. Couple this crispy goi ca (handrolls) or meaty mackerel with sweet chili jam for a serotonin-boosting spread. The three-course chef's menu on weekends; a fish feast; as well as a unique take on surf and turf also hit that proverbial spot.
"
430,"Once the power crowd’s club of choice for dining and dishing, this stallion in the former Four Seasons (now run by Major Food Group) belongs to a rarefied crowd of iconic NYC addresses. After undergoing a stylish makeover, this incarnation is once again the favored watering hole of the well-heeled. The Grill is a grandiose scene, with flashy service to match (tableside presentations are plentiful). Over in the kitchen it's all-American, with a menu of beloved classics.

"
431,"There are no decorative distractions at this efficient if spare sushi-ya located a few steps below street level. The simple space offers three rows of tables, unadorned white walls, a well-lit counter in the rear and is warmed-up by enthusiastic servers. Devoted customers know the draw here is not atmosphere, but the quality and excellent value food.Fish can be surprisingly luscious, especially the salmon, which has a remarkably clean finish and great salty note. The medium fatty tuna needs nothing more than a kiss of soy sauce. A 12-course ""omakase"" might also include giant clam, uni, sea eel, fluke, smelt roe, and for dessert, tamago. The kanto soba is excellent too, with a rich soy-bonito broth brimming with scallions, seaweed and a fish cake.

432,"The team behind Sunday in Brooklyn strikes gold again, this time with Japanese-leaning cuisine. And although it is flanked by warehouses, the interior design of this hip, 85-seat restaurant features a neat, sleek, Scandinavian aesthetic.A meal here is delightfully untethered by tradition, so much so that even sake is brought into focus. The simple, shareable plates are most cherished and include vegan items, like house-made chilled silken tofu with soy milk, okra, ginger, and black garlic. Offered with soy dashi and wasabi, tomatoes lend a pop of color and sweetness to this custardy dish. Pescatarains revel in the fresh tuna and nori ensemble accompanied by palate-cleansing cucumber; while karaage and tsukune have fiends of the fowl clucking for more.
"
433,"If you build it, they will come: and sure enough, from the moment Saraghina opened its doors to a just-burgeoning Bed-Stuy, diners have flooded this cool, multi-room restaurant decorated with garage-sale knickknacks, old butcher signs and marmalade jars. It’s downright adorable. But, the delicious food is what fills these seats.Still best known for their irresistible pizzas, blistered to puffy perfection, the menu offers all kinds of heavenly dishes not to miss, like the fried calamari and shrimp, served with tangy lemon and aïoli; or a wood fire-roasted side of cauliflower mixed with creamy mascarpone, tart labneh and Marcona almonds.Just around the corner, at 433 Halsey, a sister bakery serves up fresh pastries and a mean espresso all day.

434,"The Lobster Club marks the third act in the revamping of the old Four Seasons dining room, housed within the landmark Seagram Building. The interior now looks like a mod Japanese brasserie, thanks to a white onyx bar counter, pink and chartreuse upholstery, as well as walls hung with bold artwork. Chef Tasuku Murakami’s menu may be sizable, but it repeatedly returns to Japan for inspiration. Sample an array of teppanyaki, such as scallops, first grilled, then brushed with savory sauce and toasted sesame seeds; or charred vegetables like king oyster mushrooms and shishito peppers. Other favorites include seafood mains like gently cooked black bass in an herbaceous yuzu sauce.Japanese whisky aficionados should head to the bar as it pours over 30 labels.

At once luxurious and cozy, the space features a monochromatic palette, sleek cocktail lounge and sultry vibe that begs for a date night.The focus is its open kitchen, where the chef strikes an intense, monk-like figure as he prepares seasonal and delightfully inspired dishes. While some flavors are decidedly more French (duck à l'orange), find Japanese touches in the seaweed-infused breads and Icelandic cod in sake-cream sauce. Desserts are as outstanding as the beverages, as in the passion fruit mousse and ""cheesecake cream"" covered by a crunchy disc of Okinawa brown sugar.

437,"Upbeat, modern and cool, Llama Inn pays respect to all styles of Peruvian cooking, but with the technical flair of Chef Erik Ramirez who has trained in New York’s top restaurants. The result is a fresh, fun and spontaneous cuisine that aims to elevate Peruvian food. Anticuchos, either the scallop with aji amarillo tartare and crispy capers or the beef hearts with aja panca and rocoto salsa, are packed with flavor, while the ceviche also delivers with an added crunch courtesy of deep-fried plantains. Duck sausage over a bed of cilantro-spiked rice studded with spinach and choclo is another hit. Finish with a slice of their key lime pie.Llamita Inn, their small Manhattan outpost, specializes in Peruvian rotisserie chicken and causa.

438,"No detail goes unnoticed at this clean and contemporary Swedish beauty, sporting a sleek bar and open kitchen with Chef Emma Bengtsson at the helm. Suited servers glide about seamlessly through the dining room, outfitted with wide-plank oak floors, an undulating wood slat ceiling, blue banquettes and modern Danish chairs.It is a great spot for a shot of the eponymous infused spirit along with a bite from one of three menus, unveiling such classics as meatballs and pork schnitzel. The cuisine is as refined as its Nordic presentations are updated. Expect glazed earthenware, slate platters and wooden boxes cradling the likes of matjes herring, neatly trimmed, subtly smoked and matched with wafer-thin rye toast, cured egg yolk and a hint of pear. Perfectly poached lobster may then arrive with ribbons of celeriac, black trumpet mushrooms and toasted hazelnuts for divine flavor and crunch; while precise and soignee aptly describe the brightly hued sea trout crowned with savory roe and sweet apple elements. And, simplicity is indeed the peak of elegance in desserts, like the lemon mousse with black currants and crème fraîche.If you find yourself across the pond, visit the London sibling.
"
439,"This neighborhood charmer broke more than a few hearts when it briefly closed in 2018 after a small fire, but Greenpoint’s beloved Anella is back—and better than ever. Tucked into the bustling north end of Franklin Street, two jumbo windows glow from the warm, old-fashioned interior inside, fitted out with rustic wood and sepia-toned mirrors.Guatemalan-born Chef Mayo Orozco’s menu is delicious, straightforward and carefully composed. Starters include familiar but beautifully composed dishes like mussels, kale salad and grilled octopus; while heartier fare might range from steak frites to branzino and herb risotto. Don’t miss the creamy garlic hummus, laced with cauliflower and studded with whole chickpeas, then paired with house-made harissa and toast.
"
440,"Madre sits at the base of the boutique Franklin Guest House, where industrial elements meet modern elegance. Make your way past stunning carved doors to arrive at the hotel—the restaurant has a separate entrance. Here, diners will find it hard to resist the kitchen team's sensational and contemporary cooking. Dishes that take center stage in this multi-level space include a shareable plate of Castelvetrano olives and croquetas. From there, indulge in agnolotti stuffed with chestnut crema and sage; or Kurobuta pork with Jimmy Nardello peppers and preserved plums. Pot de crème with Mast Brothers chocolate and Maldon sea salt is worth your undivided attention.A patio with views of the sun-kissed river adds another divine layer to this dreamy venture.
"
441,"This traditional Italian restaurant nestled inside the historic Hotel des Artistes is cherished for its well-executed favorites. Retaining that X factor from its previous incarnation as Café des Artistes, it is also a vault for everyone from artists to corporate bigwigs. Unsurprisingly, a sense of grandiosity exudes from its myriad frescos, oddly configured series of rooms, and striking restrooms. The cooking covers Italy's various regions and may unveil a lasagna Ennese, layering pork ragù, Marsala wine and Piacentinu cheese; or braised coniglio with lampascioni, wild mushrooms and chestnuts.On Sundays for a no-cork fee, guests can choose a wine to enjoy with the chocolate-and-pistachio Sicilian cannoli, or in lieu of dessert, a fine cheese board.
"
442,"Don’t let the easy-breezy vibe here fool you. Oxomoco is a serious dining room, capable of great things in its wood-fired oven. The attractive interior feels like a resort, with a long bar, giant skylight to maximize the sunlight of such a narrow space, and outdoor patio. The room is lively and packed but always conducive to conversation.Tacos are the main draw, especially when piled with the likes of tender flank steak or soft-shell crab. However, this kitchen team doesn’t stick to merely one dish or area of Mexico. Instead, they reach widely across a myriad of regions, always balancing abundance with fresh and vibrant flavors. The menu thereby tempts and tantalizes with such large and small items as the tropical hamachi agua chile and tlayuda crafted from smoky corn on a shell. Other standouts include the brined, fried and smoked “giant chicken.""Apprised diners know never to pass up on creative and clever delicacies like the hoja santa curd, accompanied by roasted strawberries, raspberry granita, and finished with spicy olive oil. In close pursuit is the deceptively simple-looking carrot cake that is garnished with burnt cinnamon and flaunts a profound complexity of flavors.
"
443,"This enoteca has been a smash-hit since day one and spawned its own cluster of knockoffs, though none has quite the same talent for pairing tasty little bites with excellent wines by the glass. The smartly designed space has a marble U-shaped bar that makes use of every square inch but stays comfortable, especially for solo diners.The Italian-leaning menu’s small portions encourage diners to try a number of different plates. There is an entire heading dedicated to cheese and charcuterie; the sweet, porky finocchiona is a good bet. Butter-tender octopus atop braised gigante beans and greens makes a solid impression, but don't wave away the bread basket, as you'll want it to sop up every last trace of the white wine sauce bathing those veal meatballs. 
"
444,"Nothing nourishes like ramen and nothing divides opinion more than ramen, as every self-respecting foodie seems to have an incontestable opinion about where to find the best.  Hide-Chan, a franchise of a Japanese chain, is certainly a worthy candidate, as the prices are keen and it’s perennially busy. It’s on the second floor of a nondescript building—a fact you’ll no doubt be aware of as you’ll probably be queuing on the staircase.The specialty is tonkatsu ramen, which is based on pork bones and originated in Fukuoka where it’s referred to as Hakata ramen. The cloudy, rich broth will leave you feeling invigorated, especially if you opt for firmer noodles with a little bite. Start with homemade gyoza with their authentically sticky bottoms.
"
445,"One gets the impression that there are few rules inside this easygoing establishment. The rustic room is expansive and spread out as if ready for a party. Lights strung across the ceiling emit an amber glow; and the walls feature a dive bar-like riot of colorful scribbles and drawings by customers (anybody can make a mark).Make no mistake though, as this kitchen knows exactly what it’s doing. The style is Korean but with a playful edge. Think fried rice cakes submerged in a cheesy kimchi sauce or smoky bacon-studded fried rice. It’s all meant for sharing, unless you’re here just for a bowl of ramyun (try the Hungover Seoul). Groups may split the giant beef marinated short rib served with salad greens tossed in a clever nori vinaigrette.
"
446,"Things are mighty cheery at this ""casa,"" which should come as no surprise as its mission appears to bring the beauty and nature of Venezuela to NYC. Fittingly, the passionate and charming staff busy themselves guiding the hungry guests through a cluster of explosively flavorful dishes. A bar up front keeps the crowds abuzz; while the long, deep, and dark dining room is all mood.Begin with arepitas full of chicken salad, queso blanco, shredded beef, pork, and curry mayo; or crispy mandocas with creamy and spreadable nata. Save room for the main act, also referred to as pollo, starring creamy rice, chorizo, fennel, red peppers, and a separate side of crisp buttermilk-fried chicken. Counter the carbs and call it a night with a light, bright coconut yogurt.
"
447,"Oh, to be a diner on the move in Greenpoint these days. It seems like another fun-but-food-focused operation is opening every other week in this neighborhood, and Citroën (brought to you by local residents, Craig Kafton and Dawn Eldridge) is certainly no exception. Imagine terrific French-minded cooking and stirring craft cocktails, served up in an irreverent space with braided wood banisters, velvety wallpaper, and chocolate leather booths.Dinner might begin with a wonderful basket of fresh bread, served with house-whipped, caramelized onion butter; or a fan of tissue-thin smoked salmon with bright capers, red onion, and horseradish crème fraîche. A classic coq au vin then arrives perfectly prepared, with soft pearl onions, lardons, and potato purée.
"
448,"The exterior pays homage to New York's beloved bodegas, but the light-filled interior has a crisp, modern vibe thanks to glossy blonde wood tables, exposed brick walls and a small, polished bar that's perfect for both solo diners and couples. This bright little spot aims to showcase Taiwan's culinary landscape with a fresh perspective. Don’t miss briny clams in a thick bath of Shaoxing rice wine, bobbing with cubes of butternut squash and red kabocha. This may be paired with soft bao—their unique twist is as addictive as it is sloppy—and tailed by thick and chewy zha jiang mian (noodles simmered with tender lamb, chili oil, and Sichuan peppercorn).A word to the wise: scallion pancakes accompany a host of items here, so skip the appetizer order. 
"
449,"Set on a less polished stretch of Grand Street, this quintessential Italian gem is bound to surprise the moment you enter. The large and welcoming space draws you in thanks to an impressive wood bar, sleek dining tables and a handsome penny-tiled floor. Both the tables and light olive-tinged walls are dressed minimally—the former with wild flowers and the latter with beautifully framed photos. The garden outside will transport you to a trattoria in Umbria—on a dime.The well-edited menu spins to the season, but get nibbling on grilled pancetta spiedini, topped with a spicy aïoli and agro dolce. Follow this up with such light and simple pastas as garganelli tossed with a cream-kissed ragù Bolognese and Parmigiano—this is Italian cuisine in all its glory.
"
450,"This restaurant knows you’ve been dreaming about Cali again. And so they’ve arrived, in the heart of Greenpoint, to transport you there for the night. Tucked into a pretty, light-filled space that radiates clean, contemporary polish, it offers a rather unique experience—including a 200+ California wine list, where even the fanciest of the fancy bottles are presented in two- and five-ounce pours.Alongside this dreamy wine list but in no way playing second fiddle is a small, curated menu, featuring vibrant and well-executed fare. Highlights may include the gently poached chicken, served with avocado, charred cucumber and ginger-buttermilk sauce; or the creamy chicken liver mousse, paired with a thatch of fresh microgreens and almond-flour crackers. 
"
451,"A pierogi spot from a husband-and-wife team appears to be exactly what this neighborhood wants, gauging form its buzzy vibe. Illuminated by a soft glow, this long and narrow space culminates in a small atrium. Matching blonde banquette seating, exposed brick walls and vertical wood beams may be found in between.There is a service station in the middle displaying Bolesławiec pottery, which is also the vessel of choice for their assorted Polish food. Consider delicate parcels filled with jalapeño, mashed potato, and bacon. Other savory combos may include hearty borscht and golabki (cabbage stuffed with pork, rice and topped with tomato-basil sauce). The raspberry and sweet cheese pierogi makes a sweet counterpart to the savory options.
"
452,"Chef Jake Eberle’s cute corner restaurant shows us that not every dish needs reimagining and not every recipe requires reinterpretation. He’s a French-trained chef whose cooking is comfortingly classic—and his well-balanced menu showcases simplicity and honesty. That’s not to say his food doesn’t pack a punch: Sir William Farm pink ham with buttermilk dressing has a lovely briny sweetness; brown butter-roasted hake in a foamy lobster bisque kissed with sweet sherry and sweet plump ""drunken"" black raisins is delightful.Globe lights hang from the ceiling to illuminate a sea-blue room with bespoke wooden furniture. The comforting vibe is amplified by the thoughtful pricing, especially the four-course prix fixe that will turn you into a regular in no time. 
"
453,"This fantastically delicious find tucked away at the end of Greenpoint is the passion project of jazz musician Luca Fadda, his wife Giorgia, and their longtime friend Nicola Paganelli.A striking whitewashed façade and black doors signal the entry to this gem, which dons a uniquely Italian spirit by way of shiny marble tables and planters galore. The communal tables encourage lingering, perhaps over the likes of on-site baked breads and fresh pastas. Speaking of, the spaghetti alla carbonara with guanciale, parmesan, and cracked black pepper is a feast; followed by white wine-glazed meatballs with lemon and parsley. The fish of the day turns up with crispy panelle; but for your meal's end, there's no going wrong with the ricotta-rich cannolo. 
 
"
454,"Set in the space formerly occupied by Le Cirque (in the striking curved glass edifice of the Bloomberg building), the crowd here is a mix of the corporate and idle rich. Lofty ceilings, sculptural chandeliers, and geometric patterns dominate the interior; hues of royal blue make a nice contrast against the gleaming metal, dark wood, and leather banquettes.The menu minors in solid renditions of Sichuan classics like dan dan noodles and mapo tofu, but unusual takes on dim sum is where it earns honors. Highlights include xiao long bao, which quite literally bursts with the porky richness of hot and sour soup (featuring wood ear mushroom, black vinegar, and zesty chilies), as well as truffle-redolent steamed buns crafted into clever facsimiles of shiitakes.
"
455,"Fronted by windows that open up on to bustling Graham Avenue, this space is outfitted with patterned wallpaper, snug banquettes and communal tables. Mexico City native, Chef Ivan Garcia is at the helm of the hot spot, where wolfish appetites are sated with richly flavored cooking. Meatless Mondays bring a chile relleno vegetariano, or roasted poblano stuffed with zucchini, carrots, and corn; while carnivores delight in the carne asada with jalapeño rajas con crema. Partake in tacos like the suadero, or torta tinga de pollo with a roll to sop up the sauce. Reposado and mango embellish the pastel tres leches—and to keep the tequila flowing, hit up Zona Rosa.When the sun shines, outdoor dining comes to life with planters, bright chairs, and large umbrellas.
"
456,"There are flowers everywhere, making this discreet little restaurant in the Lowell Hotel one of the prettiest around—and ideal for trysts and tête-à-têtes. Efficient, white-jacketed waiters scurry about, while unruffled, suited managers keep everything on an even keel and never fail to recognize a regular.Lunch fills with locals as, alongside the French à la carte, there’s a 40-minute menu of easy charm for those with afternoon assignations. At night the menu expands to include the wider Mediterranean. Morocco, home to the eponymous painter’s magnificent Majorelle Garden, also lends some influence with a selection of tagines. Classic desserts remind you why you first fell in love with everything Gallic: oeuf à la neige, soufflés, baba au rhum. 
"
457,"From the razor-sharp service staff and its charming décor (think elegantly set wood tables and banquettes), to the killer but notably traditional French menu, everything about this buzzing hangout in burgeoning Bed-Stuy is bang-on. The fact that it is surrounded by bodegas and a fast food joint simply adds to the overall intrigue.Owner Amadeus Broger is the master of operations here and appears to have just one, single formula in mind—and that is to churn out serious food in a fun and convivial setting. Don’t miss the soufflé au fromage, rendered light and frothy with nutty Comté; the tournedos Rossini, tender filet mignon over a potato pancake, topped with foie gras medallions and finished with Madeira; or the perfectly executed duck a l’orange.
"
458,"Bright, fresh and elegantly appointed Chola is nestled amidst chic design shops and upscale dining spots. Warm and hospitable servers are at the ready in its dining room, which dons polished wood floors, grey upholstery and cream walls. Even their ubiquitous lunch buffet does little to distract, keeping all eyes on the prize—intensely flavorful Indian food.Dishes arrive in gleaming metal bowls, enticing diners to dig in to the likes of tandoor and vegan specialties. However, the underlying theme is southern coastal cuisine, as revealed in a delicious Goan fish curry redolent of coconut milk and tamarind. Your meal may reach a high point with rich and peppery Chettinad chicken curry. Matched with curry leaf-studded lemon rice, it's a match made in heaven.
"
459,"With corrugated metal walls, movie posters, and no solid tables to speak of, this bi-level gem looks nothing like a restaurant. In fact, lecture-hall seats, garden lights, and action flicks projected onto a wall create a kitschy feel. But in the end, there is no denying the quality of its cuisine. Think real-deal Thai, with heat that verges on ferocious and flavoring that never ends. Fried chicken laab arrives with herbs; while tilapia is dressed with an electrifying mix of lime, chili, and garlic. Northern-style beef is cooked in a warming broth with tripe, liver, and Sichuan peppercorn.The music is loud at first, but eventually you'll find yourself eating along to the beats, wondering how much more heat you can handle, and plotting your return for more.
"
460,"Everyone needs a little pomp and circumstance now and then and, for these grand occasions, there will always be Daniel. This neo-classical citadel of Gallic sophistication will certainly impress your guests—the tables are impeccably dressed and a battalion of immaculately groomed staff runs it. They add some nice touches too, like presenting you at the end of dinner with your own printed menu as well as a box of canelé to take home.The setting features foliage-patterned fabric on the walls and the dining room boasts an abundance of potted plants. For those who prefer a more casual vibe, dining alfresco is an absolute thrill, thanks to tables shielded by pink canvas that in turn evoke images of private beachside cabanas.On the menu side of things, Riviera was a prevailing theme and included a saffron-tinged bouillabaisse, generously stocked with top-notch seafood. Then came the humble cod and artichoke, which were baked in olive oil and draped over a lentil purée for an especially elevated creation. Similarly, desserts like the sunny tarte Tropizienne filled with ruby grapefruit-tinted cream, were emblematic of a kitchen team with an impressive level of technical skill and artistic vision.
"
461,"The 90s are back and so is JoJo—famed chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s first New York restaurant. Like the very best face-lift, this transformation has rid the space of its former fuddy-duddy feel and replaced it with a fresh, contemporary backdrop that beckons moneyed residents.Good taste never goes out of style and diners hoping for a little culinary nostalgia will be rewarded here. The menu isn’t groundbreaking (think: roast chicken and Maine lobster) but it is very well executed. The kitchen’s daily menu invites patrons to enjoy a different classic nightly, though some dishes including the Peekytoe crab dumplings, are always on offer. Just one bite of the luxurious molten chocolate cake and memories of Y2K will come flooding back all the way.
"
462,"Sometimes you can hear the sound of sizzling woks in the kitchen of this Sichuan dining venture. It’s a good omen in Long Island City, which isn’t known for its Asian cuisine but may be soon, thanks to Hupo. The sleek space is narrow and long, with dark hardwood floors and lofty ceilings.Such a quaint setting is an apt pairing for the small, focused menu that features regional favorites like spicy mapo tofu, house-made cold noodles slicked in a sweet and spicy chili oil, as well as Chungking spicy chicken. Nothing blasts of heat here, so spice junkies are unlikely to break a sweat. Still, dishes like stewed fish fillet in hot chili soup arrive chock-full of minced garlic and channel the kind of fiery, umami-driven complexity we crave from this cuisine.
"
463,"The polished Elea has been a hit out of the gate as its décor is picture perfect and the menu replete with classic Greek fare. Fitted out with whitewashed brick walls, weathered wood beams, and pretty lighting, the bi-level space exudes all the easy-breezy feels. Add on the deliciously rustic food and you have a win. Imagine everything from creamy spreads with pita bread to fresh fish to get your taste buds going. Following suit, ingredients are given the spotlight in the likes of htipiti (feta with roasted chili pepper); taramasalata with cured ikura and pickled capers; as well as whole grilled tsipoura in a lemon, olive oil, and caper sauce.Finish with elmek, mountain tea-infused custard crème in shredded phyllo and topped with crumbled pistachio. 
"
464,"The staff is upbeat, and the room is attractively minimal in design, but what really stands out here is the adoration of this little sushi-ya’s devoted clientele. Sushi Daizen is one of the only places in the area that offers omakase and the mood is light and engaging as everyone digs in, with options to add sashimi or a small list of à la carte pieces.Start your meal with a cool appetizer of enoki mushrooms in soy and dashi broth, or crisp green beans over creamy tofu. The sushi course presents a progression of neatly trimmed, hand-formed morsels of fish. Highlights include excellent poached tiger shrimp, Santa Barbara sea urchin and kawa kawa from Japan. The fatty tuna hand roll, tucked with scallions for a delicious pop, is a perfect finale.
"
465,"Entering through this (now) iconic red door is like a trip through the looking glass and into Bushwick’s foodie wonderland. The city’s love affair with Roberta’s seems stronger each year, and for good reason. Everything from the industrial space to the underground bohemian vibe epitomizes Brooklyn-chic. Takeaway is always an option, so when the wait for a table is too long, snag a porchetta sandwich to-go.Queens native Carlo Mirarchi is the master craftsman here, turning out a range of creatively named pizzas, including one that mixes pineapple and prosciutto, soppressata and jalapeño, or arrabiata with sesame seeds. Groups might consider sharing a beautifully browned, half-moon calzone stuffed with pepperoni as well as melted ricotta and caciocavallo.
"
466,"As the saying goes, the nose knows. These are words to live by at this vibrant Argentinian parilla. With prawns and dry-aged steaks sizzling over a roaring grill, a subtle smoke wafts through the long dining room, built out of sleek wood, exposed brick, and dangling greenery. Come summer, the party is further back out on the well-tended patio.Bring friends because this food is meant to be shared, like hearty empanadas stuffed with mushroom and spinach or filet and olives. Black rice with grilled prawn and fried calamari is a seafood thrill; though the hulking double-cut pork chop, cooked to a juicy medium-rare and served with mustard greens is most impressive. Much like the restaurant, it channels the smoky undertones and comfort of a backyard barbecue.
"
467,"With black floors, stark white tables, and white chairs, Bellwether looks a little too cool for comfort, but don’t let that fool you. This friendly neighborhood spot is good for all hours and all crowds, backed by a talented kitchen that turns out comforting, seasonal dishes with flair in spades. Though appetizers like chilled oysters with tomato fresco or the heirloom carrots with herb-coconut yogurt certainly tempt, we’re all-in on the charred broccolini served with cilantro tahini, pickled carrots, and toasted sesame. Entrées pack in just as much flavor, like fork-tender pork cheeks paired with grilled pineapple and onion soubise.Desserts are sizeable but just too easy to devour solo, like the glossy lemon tart with whipped cream and olive oil.
"
468,"This gleaming kitchen for serious eaters is located deep within the compound that helped elevate this industrial quadrant of Bushwick into a perch for haute cuisine. It takes a bit of a luck to score a seat at Blanca, as seating is limited and very much in demand, but you'll feel blessed indeed once you settle in. Here, products and dishes take inspiration from around the world, while warm, fluid service keeps the mood friendly among the small group.Blanca serves a carefully conceived multi-course tasting that promises immense creativity and an artist’s ability to weave an unforgettable experience. This is dinner theater, with all eyes fixed on the open kitchen of Chef Carlo Mirarchi quietly turning out plates of perfection. The execution, even in simple dishes, is par excellence.Menus aren’t presented until the end of the meal, but list dishes like sunflower seed “milk” topped with Pink Lady apple cubes and a mouth-coating grating of foie gras, tied together with chili and salt flakes. Fantastic pastas include tightly wound strands of cavatappi tossed in a spicy, creamy sauce made ultra-rich with the addition of Hokkaido uni. Makrut lime makes coconut ice and cashew ice cream refreshing and quite delicious.
"
469,"The word “touristy” is mostly used pejoratively but there’s no denying that sometimes visitors to the city know a good thing when they see one. Loeb Boathouse was built in 1954 and includes an outdoor bar and a restaurant whose glass wall folds away in the summer to give every table a great view of the lake. If you want to swap the chaos of the city and its cacophony of car horns for a couple of tranquil hours, then here’s where to come. The menu is a mix of American and European classics alongside less successful dishes of a more innovative persuasion. Try the robustly seasoned linguine with littleneck clams or Scottish salmon with chickpea purée.While brunch and lunch are year-long affairs, dinner is only served during warmer months.
"
470,"What’s not to love about this old-school delicatessen? Legions of customers flock here—and have been for a century. Barney Greengrass is an institution, complete with the requisite Formica-clad counters and beloved-but-blunt servers.Loyal fans routinely swing by for this craveable food. Cured and smoked fish, as well as deli items may be the classic order, but they also serve a terrific breakfast. Start your day off on the right foot with a Nova scramble sided by a bagel and cream cheese. The menu offers a roster of all-time favorites: homemade chicken liver, smeared on a toasted bialy, with hard-boiled egg and caramelized onions is always a good bet; as is an overstuffed pastrami sandwich on soft rye, served with mustard and crunchy half-sours.
"
471,"A local standby that doesn’t actually look like much, Sushi Seki combines exceptional sushi and sashimi with a casual vibe that keeps neighborhood loyalists packed in for late-night dinners and takeout. It may seem like a simple restaurant for a very good spicy tuna roll, but their unique omakase is what makes it a worthy favorite. Dedicated itamae bring quality and creativity to each bite. Sample toro chopped with ginger that is at once tender, rich and crunchy over rice; or a slice of fatty salmon with avocado sauce. But, for a true treat, go for their signature hand roll of toasted nori surrounding chopped juicy scallop with crunchy tempura flakes, tobiko and spicy mayo.An expanded location in Hell’s Kitchen offers an attractive array of seating options.
"
472,"This corner spot marks the first American location of a popular dining chain that began in Delhi and now boasts outposts throughout India. Here in NYC, Moti Mahal Delux offers two distinct seating areas: an earth-toned dining room and windowed sidewalk atrium.Their Northern-leaning cuisine traces back to the kitchens of the Mughal Empire, which brought Muslim influences to the Indian subcontinent. Lunch is limited, while dinner is more rewarding, featuring tandoori preparations like anardana tikka—grilled chicken infused with a pomegranate and black pepper marinade. Delightful flavors abound through the brick-red mutton curry with spiced tomato, onion and ginger; paratha dusted with dried mint; as well as the mustard seed- and curry leaf-infused lemon rice.
"
473,"From the French chefs, staff and owners, to that nation’s culinary favorites (moules, but of course!), Amelie is the embodiment of that winsome neighborhood bistro of your dreams.The postage stamp-sized restaurant radiates with warmth, so settle in with a glass of wine before perusing the menu—it's scattered with delicacies alongside as an ever-changing roster of specials. A perfect sphere of goat cheese rolled in crushed pistachios and drizzled with honey starts things off right. Then move on to the delicate, Southern France-inspired ravioli filled with Comté and a blend of cheeses in a heady vegetable-based broth. Since prices are as palatable as the dishes, throw in truffle slices for a luxe accompaniment and you have a signature-in-the-making.
"
474,"Chef Yukihiro Takeda is the intellect behind this charming and focused sushi lair. The slim and rustic space welcomes all with an L-shaped counter abuzz with a handful of lucky diners. Brick walls, both glazed and exposed, make for a simple canvas, thereby allowing all eyes to remain focused on the prize—original and inspired nigiri.Your meal may open with translucent slices of branzino augmented by vinegared jelly, shiso, and daikon. Then comes the nigiri, including the likes of sublime fatty tuna with a delicate brushing of soy; tailed by addictively chewy red snapper imbued with fresh citrus. A giant clam with lemon is a light delight; while a salmon roulade stuffed with a mix of tofu and mushrooms and served in a cool dashi is nourishing.
"
475,"From the bar lined with retro metal stools to the suspended fluorescent lighting and white floors, there is a definite vintage cantina vibe to this place, which offers a menu modeled after the lunch spots you'd find in Mexico City. Choose from yarrancan, or tortas, tacos, a la plancha dishes and sides. Sartén de palo presents two small corn tortillas filled with pastor-rubbed tuna, grilled pineapple, shaved white onion and a lime crema for a bite that is at once sour, sweet and savory. While tortas come in half portions, additions like Oaxaca cheese and pickled tomatillos may have you hankering for a whole. Elote asado, grilled corn slathered with creamy mayo and topped with crumbles of queso fresco, chili and a wedge of lime, bursts with flavor.
"
476,"Dagon calls this prominent corner of Broadway home and is appealingly flanked by large windows. Inside, the room is open, spacious and easy-breezy, infused with shades of teal. Large glass light fixtures illuminate the off-center bar—ideal for solo diners—and the long counter, which is definitely the preferred perch among many a patron here.The menu is a clear and nuanced expression of Middle Eastern flavors, as may be evidenced by a well-dressed salad of onion, cucumber, tomato and schug. Fresh-baked breads, like kubaneh accompanied by creamy labneh, shouldn't be missed. Chicken liver mousse with mustard seeds and date syrup is a match made in culinary heaven; while short rib tagine with fluffy couscous makes for a flavor-packed feast.
"
477,"Occupying a prominent corner of the Upper West Side, this delightful operation arrives courtesy of Chef Jun Park. The space is narrow, deep and neat, with tables offering a view of the whirring open kitchen. Wood-covered walls illuminated by pendant lights result in an atmospheric vibe.Asian cooking with Korean leanings is what this team does best, so await—with bated breath—the likes of piping-hot fried chicken, its crisp amber skin and ivory meat permeated with spicy gochujang and sweet peanut sauce. Fried rice, that ubiquitous menu favorite, is turned on its head with the likes of complex truffle essence. Then, almost-as-big-as-a-cat's-head biscuits arrive with truffle-spiked honey to ratchet up the decadence quotient. 
"
478,"Occupying the same corner location since 2013, this Vietnamese wonder has reemerged thanks to the direction of Chef Eric Tran. Don't be fooled by the industrial surrounds though, as it is an edgy destination for finer dining. Even the space feels updated and stylish, with dark wood-plank floors, white walls and a counter set aglow by woven rattan ceiling pendants.Ambitious dishes with classic inspiration are the order of the day with winners like confit duck neck, rice paper handrolls and house-made pork-lemongrass sausages. For a more leisurely dining experience, consider one of the chef's affordable tasting menus, which yield inventions such as corn congee with shrimp toast or noodle stir-fry with five-spice beef.
"
479,"Its classic art nouveau styling makes this popular French brasserie de luxe infinitely more 7th arrondissement than Upper East Side. The efficient service is overseen by managers armed with authentic French accents and highly skilled in the art of flirting and flattery—the immaculately coiffured Orcéens may be a sophisticated bunch of customers but they expect a generous side order of Gallic charm to go with their classic French cuisine.All the favorites are here, from escargots to lobster bisque, quenelle Lyonnaise to île flottante, and the kitchen prepares them with a healthy respect for tradition. There are also plenty of salads for those who’ve given up wondering how French women can eat this kind of food without ever going to the gym.
"
480,"Antonio Sinesi has been impressing the Milanese for the last 15 years. Now, with Il Divo, he’s impressing stateside. The small space exudes charm and elegance with 1920s movie posters and sparkling chandeliers. The exceptionally warm staff adds to the inviting ambience—the manager may even stop by with a complimentary grappa at meal’s end. The menu focuses largely on Northern Italian cooking with a few classics sprinkled in. Beef tenderloin, poached in olive oil and tossed with arugula and Parmesan crisps, melts in your mouth. The 12 eggs spaghetti isn’t flashy but is so well executed, and the bacon-wrapped scallops over chickpea bisque is a delightful dish. The wine list leans Italian but features some exciting bottles at palatable prices.  
"
481,"Posterity will remember J.G. Melon as a coveted NY institution. Make your way into this 1920's structure, marked by a neon sign and set upon a cozy corner, where the timeless vibe, telltale green-and-white checked tablecloth, and cheery staff make up most of its allure. Drinks are steadily churned out at a dark wood bar, so arrive early to avoid the crowds.The focus at this multi-generational saloon is the burger—paired with a lip-smacking Bloody Mary at lunch. The warm toasted bun topped with rosy-pink meat is coupled with onions, pickles, and crinkle-cut fries. Be forewarned: you will go through an entire stack of napkins before finishing. Other simple pleasures include salads, steaks and eggs. Seal the deal with a chocolate chip-studded layer cake.
"
482,"What began as a string of incredibly popular ceviche bars in the Gansevoort and Canal Street Markets, has now become Chef José Luis Chávez’s first sit-down restaurant. This fresh space is clean and modern, with a polished, easygoing vibe; a solid wine list; and some terrific cocktails (including a few creative takes on pisco sours).The brilliance of Chef Chávez’s citrus-marinated ceviches is the traditional way in which they are presented—something like a Peruvian cousin to the poke bowl. Also on the roster are other classics from the same nation, like corn, quinoa and potatoes woven into hearty mains. Think: arroz con mariscos (a paella-like dish) and pork chaufa, fried rice studded with bits of pork belly and fried sweet plantains. 
"
483,"Silky-smooth spreads, homemade yogurt, grilled meats and fragrantly spiced stews have solidified Persepolis’ reputation as one of the city’s finest Persian restaurants. Linen-draped tables, spacious banquettes and big windows facing Second Avenue fashion a look that inspires dressing up (or not). Service is always gracious, if at times too earnest.The kitchen shines with its eggplant halim, a creamy, steaming roasted eggplant and onion dip with tender lentils and a dollop of yogurt on top. A kebab duo of saffron-tinged chicken and grilled beef are both succulent successes, served with basmati rice flecked with sour cherries. For dessert, try the tart-sweet Persian lemon ice studded with bits of rice noodles and doused in a deep red cherry syrup.
"
484,"By day, this elegant space in the back of Marky's Caviar Shop features wine and bites, but by night it's all about the tasting menu punctuated by caviar at every turn. Meals begin boldly with a tartare of brunoise rainbow trout, mixed with fresh dill and smoked roe, topped with carrot and radish escabeche, and finished with a herbed buttermilk sauce. It's an example where the caviar, or in this case roe, works with the ingredients and even helps to elevate the dish.Served in a blue caviar tin, the chocolate and coffee dessert is a delightful ruse when lifted to reveal the espresso-soaked ladyfinger topped with a coffee panna cotta and layer of chocolate pearls. Though wine pairings make sipping a snap, the well-versed staff is always happy to advise.
"
485,"It's old-world Bohemia, not hippie-chic, at this Czech beer hall located on the first floor of the National Bohemian Hall building. It exudes a classic European bar vibe with wood paneling, simple wood tables and vintage knick knacks. Naturally, beers and pilsners are the drink of choice, but for grape lovers, there is a nice European-focused wine list sprinkled with Czech and Austrian wines. Hearty fare is in store here. Svíčková, a flatiron steak in a deep orange all-spice accented sauce, leans sweet. Deep and flavorful, the meat is fork-tender, while the thick sauce is best when swiped up by the bread dumplings. Dumplings litter the menu, even at dessert, where strawberry-filled dumplings topped with crumbled gingerbread are a delicious finale. 
"
486,"Set on a tree-lined street in the Upper East Side, Sushi Noz blends in, but glide past its sliding door and suddenly you’re no longer in New York. There is a certain energy at the outset that courses through this sacred space, where every detail is painstakingly selected to recreate an intimate Japanese refuge. Some of the tools alone are marvels, and Chef Nozomu Abe is a meticulous and engaging craftsman.The Ash Room seats seven at the counter and offers a pure expression of seasonal nigiri, while the 200-year-old hinoki bar is where the sensei himself prepares a tasting menu of small plates in addition to the considerable omakase. Commence with confidently prepared cooked dishes, like tilefish broth with mozuku seaweed that arrives with no seasoning and yet speaks volumes in terms of flavor and texture. Hay-smoked bonito with shiso leaves and shaved nori is a testament to quality products and creative techniques.Sushi is masterfully prepared with fresh catch that is procured directly from Tokyo's Toyosu market and points beyond. Imagine Norwegian crab, Spanish bluefin tuna, and Kyushu uni; tailed by nigiri, highlighting warm, lush rice combined with deliciously chewy squid and scallop.
"
487,"After honing his skills at the New York outpost of O Ya, Chef Don Pham has made his way to this quiet residential stretch of the Upper East Side, where he delivers a profoundly solid and wallet-friendly omakase each night. This space is minimalist and very pleasant, largely thanks to the chef’s charming presence, as he informs counter guests of the provenance of each morsel of fish—most often sourced from Japan.Meals arrive primarily as a parade of nigiri, presented one piece at a time on a ceramic slab with chopped bits of pickled ginger. Highlights may reveal torched barracuda or shima-aji with a spicy dab of chilies. That procession may be broken up with delicious small plates, such as smoked bonito with shaved summer truffles and ponzu sauce.
"
488,"This Museum Mile kaffeehaus is so authentic it may as well be set along Vienna’s Ringstrasse. Instead, find it in a Beaux Arts mansion—home to the Neue Galerie, replete with 20th-century Austrian-and-German art and design. This gorgeous ground-floor den is clad in dark-stained wood with diners seated along a banquette covered in Otto Wagner fabric. Order one of the traditional specialties, including the city’s best wiener schnitzel or hearty Hungarian beef goulash, but it's the cakes and pastries that are the stuff of dreams. Linzer torte and Sachertorte are as classic as they are extraordinary. Feuilletine may be described as a chocolate mousse cake but it is anything but simple with its luscious, well-executed layers.
"
489,"Few restaurants smell as good as they look, but such is the charm of this Bushwick delight. Exposed brick and white subway tiles soar to the ceiling—in a long space designed with handsome tables and a wood-burning oven that fills the air with sweet smoke.The concise menu highlights local, seasonal ingredients as seen in the few entrées, but the true talent of this kitchen lies in its house-made pastas, offered in two portion sizes. Start light and easy with fluke crudo accented by horseradish cream and pickled onion; before going heavy on the carbs. Think bucatini with confit chicken and basil, which is a staple for good reason. Of course, there's no going wrong with daily specials, like agnolotti with broccoli, fior di latte, and lemon pangrattato.
"
490,"With its pumpkin-colored walls, dark woodwork and vintage posters, this beloved old-school mainstay offers a menu that relishes in decadent Northern Italian cooking. Picture an array of fresh pasta and veal, richly embellished with cream, authentic cheeses or truffle-infused olive oil.The insalata bianca is a monotone-white and delightfully refreshing composition of shaved fennel, sliced artichoke hearts, chopped endive and slivered hearts of palm dressed with lemony vinaigrette and Parmigiano Reggiano, all singing with black pepper freshly ground tableside. Paccheri in salsa affumicata presents large pasta tubes draped with plum tomato sauce that has been enriched with creamy smoked mozzarella and strewn with bits of roasted eggplant.
"
491,"First impressions can be deceiving at this hip Queens gastropub. From the outside, M. Wells Steakhouse looks like the old auto body garage it’s housed in, but step inside and the interior is all gloss and swagger. The dining room is a dark, sultry space—from its gold-and-black wallpapered ceiling and crystal chandeliers, to its sexy red walls, stunning bar area and open, wood-burning kitchen. Of course, the service is just as polished as the design.Though the kitchen bills itself as a steakhouse, you can’t go wrong with the excellent raw bar, creative fish entrées (maybe the “trout no trout” composed with potatoes and cabbage?) and unique appetizers. Of course desserts, like pouding chômeur topped with maple syrup, remain as outstanding as ever.
"
492,"Chef Chip Smith and wife Tina Vaughn prove hospitality isn’t dead at their posh dining room, where genuine service and excellent cuisine have Upper East Siders giddy. Menus ask diners to refrain from cell phone usage, proving that this is an endearingly old-school spot despite its young age. And the bonhomie present sets the perfect tone for astute cooking. Agnolotti filled with parsnip purée and garnished by crunchy hazelnuts boasts an impeccable start. Then savor a cylinder of flounder, luxuriously scented with Perigord black truffle and served alongside shaved carrots formed into a gratin-like cake and frilled with breadcrumbs.For a true-blue finish, try the Alsatian apple tart topped with torched custard and a single scoop of prune-Armagnac ice cream.
"
493,"Presenting a focused menu of cleverly made, high-quality seafood, it’s no surprise that this haven is still going strong. Inside, the setting is routinely packed to the gills, both up front where there is a bar and counter, as well as in the back dining room, adorned with an abundance of maritime-themed artwork.Expect to taste plenty of the namesake bivalve, hailing from Prince Edward Island. Priced by the pound and steamed in no fewer than twenty globally inspired broths, they are best when paired with killer hand-cut skinny fries. Mussels No. 23 refers to the daily special, which features these mollusks in a fragrant bath of white wine, tomatillo salsa and spicy jalapeño. When coupled with shrimp and calamari, this does indeed make for a sweet treat.
"
494,"Chef Jimmy Tu could cook his killer Vietnamese street food out of a box, and the masses would still line up. But lucky for us, he and partner/brother Jacky Tu have found bigger and better digs to park their beloved Bunker. Tucked into an industrial Bushwick block, this fun and fresh space features colorful cinder block walls, a bamboo wood bar lined with Crayola-bright metal stools and ample seating for their fans.And oh, is that fandom deserved. Think caramelized wild shrimp with heritage pork and basil; or fragrant grass-fed oxtail stew. Don’t miss the bánh xèo either, which is a crispy, turmeric-laced Vietnamese crêpe tucked with heritage bacon and wild prawns, served over crunchy bean sprouts and paired with Thai basil, red lettuce and mint.
"
495,"There is a great deal that appears simple here, but there is much more that is not. The room itself is a minimally decorated space of pale wood, bright lights and a few ikebana arrangements. However, few seem to take note; in fact, they have such a devoted fan base, all of whom seem to know to request the counter and go for the omakase, because precise plating, skilled knife work and pioneering updated sushi is where everyone’s focus remains.The kitchen’s skill shines with dishes that showcase unique creativity. Signatures include lean ruby-red slices of tuna wrapped around tofu dressed with spicy sesame oil or salmon nigiri with piping-hot sautéed tomato.Dining here requires advance planning, but they also offer takeout.
"
496,"One of the first questions a server here will ask is whether you like spicy food. Answer truthfully because this Thai kitchen does not hold back when it comes to those fiery chilies, which seem to find their way into every corner of the menu. It’s all part of the allure at this sleek dining room, built out of concrete warehouse floors and rustic metal walls accented with flecks of gold.The space is indeed a welcome hangout, where friends can crowd their table with a host of small plates, or kub klaem. Highlights like fried banana blossoms with cucumber relish, or crispy rice with fermented pork sausage and shallots deliver a whirl of textures and sharp flavors. Big plates include wok-fried noodles with soybean paste, shrimp, and sweet pickled radish.
"
497,"With a name like Gordo’s, you can be sure that portion size isn’t an issue. Of course, nobody is complaining, thanks to the talents of Chef Reyna Morales, who hails from Mexico City and whose careful handling of familiar favorites goes a long way.In the case of tacos, black tiger shrimp arrive under a blanket of melted menonita cheese and are delicious both with or without the tortilla. For quesadillas, a layer of cheese is griddled into the tortilla and then served open-face, piled high with roasted poblanos and sweet corn. This Bushwick hangout also dishes out a satisfying mole, as seen in enchiladas stuffed with tender shredded chicken. Over-ordering is most likely; yet, you’ll probably leave with takeout boxes and that is a good thing indeed.
"
498,"This contemporary Chinese restaurant is elegant and art-filled with unapologetically fiery Hunan-style cooking. The kitchen team plates authentic and bold dishes with a few American-style standbys to appease the kung pao chicken crowd.Baby cabbage in a fragrant broth with meay slices of ham and mushrooms is a savory delight. Sliced eel in chili oil is a sensation with its contrast of flavors and textures, while the pork and crab soup dumplings are a wonderful treat. The subtle but not shy Hunan-style fried rice goes way beyond standard issue. Presentations are as artful as the painting-lined walls. Chinese restaurants may not be known for dessert, but Atlas bucks that trend with its handful of offerings—especially those nutty and delicious fried rice balls with longan.  
"
499,"As part of Columbia University’s sprawl, this address is a godsend for students, faculty and locals from morning to night. Although it’s spacious with plenty of outdoor options, the popular spot doesn’t accept reservations—and has the lines to prove it. Executive Chef/partner Neil Kleinberg (also of downtown fave Clinton St. Baking Company) turns out joyful fare, and the weekday blueberry pancake special is just one reason why this place gets so much love.For lunch, a kale salad with artichoke hearts, pickled carrots and crispy chickpeas is anything but rote. Come dinnertime, the fish or steak of the day might reveal pan-seared mahi mahi with roasted cauliflower and black truffle beurre blanc, or grilled strip steak brushed with teriyaki.
"
500,"This tiny pizzeria has made a big splash with its panuozzo, a regional specialty hailing from Campania that’s a cross between a calzone and panino. The puffy plank of tender, salted dough emerges from San Matteo’s hand-built, wood-fired oven crusty and smoke-infused before being sliced and stuffed with first-rate ingredients (highlights include the ortolano’s fresh, house-made mozzarella, grilled eggplant, roasted sweet peppers and baby arugula).The room is graciously attended to and perpetually crowded with neighborhood folks stuffing their faces. In addition to the appetizing house signature, other favorites feature bright salads such as escarole with Gaeta olives, capers and gorgonzola; Neapolitan-style pizza; or the day’s special baked pasta.
"
501,"Come to Miss Mamie’s and plan to indulge, Southern style. This tiny institution just off Central Park West sports a bright, clean dining room, and is furnished with comfortable wicker chairs, roomy tables, and lots of flower arrangements. Despite its somewhat sophisticated appearance, the kitchen still embraces such tried-and-true classics as baked turkey wings, homemade meatloaf, Louisiana catfish, and a creamy red velvet cake for dessert. Grab a fresh-squeezed lemonade and dive into the sampler, stocked with deep-fried shrimp, fall-off-the-bone beef short ribs, more fried chicken, and sides of cornbread stuffing and hoppin' John.Desserts are made in house, so a slice of chocolate layer cake or wedge of sweet potato pie are mandatory. 
"
502,"East Harlem’s favorite neighborhood Italian has triumphantly returned following a move next door. Thanks to proprietors Louis and Lauren Cangiano, the popular surrounds—complete with cheery red walls, exposed brick and penny-tile floors—are as cozy and welcoming as ever.Tre Otto’s mouthwatering menu boasts home-style dishes made from recipes gathered over time. Antipasti include a luscious salad of shaved fennel and orange segments crowned by tender grilled octopus drizzled with zesty salmoriglio sauce. Freshly made trenette pasta is twirled with pesto Trapanese, a divinely rich combination of tomatoes, almonds, garlic and basil; while the flavors of pizza, topped with red onions, capers and tuna, call Sicily’s sparkling coastline to mind.
"
503,"With its colorful spirit and lineup of Southern classics, this comfortable spot—as charming and lovely as its namesake owner, born-and-bred Harlemite Melba Wilson—is a perfect reflection of the neighborhood’s flavor, culture and past. It’s a place to gather and relax over good food and drinks, from Auntie B’s mini-burgers slathered with a smoky sweet sauce to a golden-brown and berry-licious fruit cobbler that’s nothing short of heaven on a plate. Equally enticing is the Southern fried chicken—darkly bronzed, sweet and salty when paired with Melba’s iconic eggnog waffles.Expect other surprises like spring rolls stuffed with black-eyed peas, collards and cheddar cheese, as well as a healthy-minded grilled vegetable Napoleon with buffalo mozzarella.
"
504,"Show-stopping grilled meats are the main draw at this popular Nepalese chain, which lands its first U.S. outpost in Sunnyside. The dining room is sleek, with a sloped roof and bar that slings pleasant cocktails. The broad menu features both national specialties and Indian-Chinese dishes, but it is the former—particularly the ones from the “signature items” section—that are your best bet.Start with the blazing hot bhatmas<i> </i>sadeko—delectable crispy soybeans with ginger, coriander, green chili, and lemon, before girding yourself for the meat courses that follow. Sample the addictive haans ko choila (char-grilled duck with ginger and chili), or any of the other sekuwa meats (goat, chicken, mutton, or wild boar are on offer) served over puffed rice.
"
505,"This charming Indian restaurant gem, set on a quiet Sunnyside street with a flashing neon sign and bright orange awning, is bound to become a neighborhood essential. A somewhat cumbersome menu conceals the true talent behind this kitchen team, which specializes in clearly defined, utterly delicious curries.The chef hails from Goa so pack your table with everything listed under the “Indo Portuguese” section of the carte. Lamb vindaloo, for instance, is spicy, high-toned in both sweetness and acidity; while the Goan fish curry offers a more creamy, soothing bite. Tandoori lamb chops marinated in yogurt and tamarind arrive wonderfully tender and expertly charred. Servers will steer you right and suggest appropriate heat levels, so heed their advice.
"
506,"All you really need to know is that this is hands-down the best ramen above 59th Street. Sure, decorative elements are simple, and it hardly matters that this gem is hidden behind the 125th Street station’s brick escalator. What comes from the kitchen however deserves kudos. The menu is concise but full of classics like pan-fried gyoza served with an addictive sesame seed-flecked dipping sauce. Shio, shoyu and miso ramen are all delightful, but the tonkotsu ramen is a special treat. This piping-hot, almost creamy, mouth-coating distillation of pork bones is deliciously rich and stocked with fragrant chasu, pickled bamboo shoots, slivered green onion and a soft-boiled egg.For added fun, visit Kissaten Jin—an offshot serving homestyle bites and soba made by a master.
"
507,"If it were in the middle of Manhattan, the line would be out the door, but oh how lucky Astoria is to have Mar's. This charming oyster bar seems plucked out of another century with its weathered seaside tavern décor, whitewashed walls and curving bar. You’ll feel dropped into a sun-bleached, turn-of-the-century photo.Most of the menu is given over to raw seafood and New England classics; part to Mediterranean tavern small plates like sweetbreads and steak tartare. Seafood stew, pork belly skewers and steak frites are also on offer, and striped bass shows off a fine sense of technique, but that mussel toast with its griddled sourdough brushed with butter and tucked in a bowl brimming with fresh mussels bathed in a cream sauce is love letter worthy.
"
508,"Amid the leafy, brownstone-lined Mount Morris Park Historic District, Barawine is an inviting dining room overseen by Fabrice Warin (formerly the sommelier at Orsay). This eye-catching space entices Lenox Avenue passersby to step in, sip and sup, either perched at the bar area’s communal table or seated in the quieter, more intimate back dining room. Whitewashed walls attractively double as wine storage throughout.The crowd-pleasing menu defies classification and embraces many influences. Quinoa salad with tofu and seaweed will please the disciplined, while mac and cheese loaded with béchamel, Gruyère and diced ham calls out to more indulgent palates. Pan-seared branzino with aromatic herbs and a drizzle of balsamic is a treat for all.
"
509,"The inspiration for Chef Kenichi Tajima and wife Keiko’s popular venture no doubt sprang from the popularity of their initial and well-loved incarnation of Mountain Bird. It’s clear they were missed, as this hot spot in collaboration with the events organization Tastings Social, stays hopping most nights.This area has wanted for serious food for a while, and Mountain Bird brings it with style. The newly relocated corner space is intimate and cozy, with a small bar and smattering of wood tables. As the name implies, the menu bears a whimsical devotion to poultry, featuring dishes like hand-cut ostrich tartare; black truffle chicken wings and duck leg-and-turkey sausage cassoulet; along with a nightly seafood and vegetarian option.
"
510,"For all his achievements, the name Marcus Samuelsson will be forever associated with Red Rooster. This Harlem landmark still draws a crowd for its most comforting of comfort food that celebrates the neighborhood in which it resides. There may now be a branch in London, but this one’s the real McCoy and is run with genuine warmth and no little pizazz. And with Ginny’s Supper Club downstairs, its heart is always beating.There is just one thing you need to bring—your appetite. Shrimp &amp; grits, chicken &amp; waffles, mac &amp; greens: when a dish has an ampersand it will probably be big enough to share. If you’re teetering on the edge of wanton over-indulgence and need one final push, then finish with the doughnuts, which come filled with sweet potato cream.
"
511,"Unlike the island of Manhattan, Queens has seen little action in the realm of serious sushi. Therefore, it's no surprise that this long, slender, and intimate nook in Astoria is a hive of activity, with top-grade nihonshu to boot. Furthermore, the narrow ""box"" of a space, with sleek ash-blonde surfaces, is pivoted around the poised and intensely focused chef.Dinner is a single kaiseki driven by the seasons and dominated by the most pristine seafood from all shores. Matsutake soup, made with a roasted madai bones stock and squeeze of sudachi, makes a soulful beginning. Sanma marinated with koji miso and cooked in a magnolia leaf over binchotan coals is as sublime as it sounds; while finely scored squid set atop warm, seasoned rice is a fitting highlight.
"
512,"The setting at Fumo is undeniably chic, with bright white walls, light wood tables and dark leather furnishings. A wood-fired pizza oven is in the back, while the front offers sidewalk seating under a protective awning. Attractive shelving lined with canned tomatoes frames the bar area and dining room.The menu offers Italian favorites, executed with a deft hand and solid ingredients. Pizzas are 12-inches and come rossa or bianca, topped with the likes of vodka sauce, wild mushrooms or charred vegetables. Excellent pastas, like the penne Caprese, are tossed with tomato sauce, fresh basil and creamy mozzarella. A neatly deboned, beautifully seasoned branzino arrives subtly flavored with fresh herbs and alongside wilted spinach as well as a lemon wedge.
"
513,"Housed within a brick storefront across from the City College of New York, this authentic little Mexican spot is a true neighborhood gem. Its interior is simple, outfitted with wood tables, warm lighting, and a Dia de los Muertos mural. A small bar faces the white-tiled open kitchen, where cooks work the grill and press house-made corn tortillas at a steady clip.The street food of Mexico City inspires Chef Cassandra Rhodes’ concise, well-conceived menu. Authentic tacos and antojitos pepper the carte, alongside homey creations like braised chicken salsa verde enchiladas, smothered in melted queso Oaxaca; or braised octopus tostadas, paired with mandarin salsa. Save room for irresistible churros, served with chocolate- and cinnamon-caramel sauces. 
"
514,"Abyssinia’s expansion couldn’t be better timed, for the local Ethiopian population surrounding its Harlem location has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years. Expanded digs mean no one leaves hungry, including the gluten-intolerant diners lining up for the injera—a spongy, sourdough risen flatbread that performs the task of cutlery, and is also ideal for sopping up all the great flavors from this authentic kitchen.The dining room is spacious and flooded with natural light; the staff gracious; and the décor simple and functional. This is essentially light, healthy and spicy cooking, and the best way to experience it is to come with a group and order a slew of entrées to sample. Whatever you do, save room for the delicious slow-cooked beef awaze tibs.
"
515,"Following the closure of the original location a few years ago, fans of Senegalese cuisine are happy to see the return of this West Harlem café run by a pair of Dakar natives. A giant fork and spoon hanging on the wall are whimsical decorative accents in a room of pale yellow hues and faux marble-topped tables, where placemats double as menus displaying Africa Kine’s myriad offerings.Keep it simple with grilled fish or meat sided by a salad, or opt for more succulent items such as peanut butter-enriched lamb mafe or suppa kandja (lamb and fish simmered in an okra and golden palm oil sauce). Note that some dishes are only available on certain nights, and although lunch is a more limited affair, Senegal’s national treasure, thiebou djeun, is always on offer.
"
516,"Judge a book by its cover and miss the rustic pleasures found within this old-time Greek retreat. The room is tiny and the tables are bare, topped with butcher paper, but of all the many tavernas that line these Astoria streets, Gregory's is one of the more serious and charming, turning out refreshingly honest and intensely flavorful cooking.Begin with tirokafteri, a satisfying spread of feta blended with pickled red chili peppers and served with hot pita points. Lightly fried eggplant and zucchini plated with a garlicky potato spread demonstrate an epic study in crunchy textures and creamy flavors. Then gently cooked sole seasoned with sweet red pepper powder and served with asparagus as well as cauliflower depicts the best in cuisine, Greek style!
"
517,"There are no distractions at this authentic Egyptian café. The look is simple and alcohol isn’t offered since this is a strictly Muslim establishment, but friendly service provides the small space with just enough ambience.Seafood is without a doubt the star attraction here. Whole fish are pulled from their icy display and thrown onto a sizzling flattop to be barbecued Egyptian-style (blackened and sprinkled with spices and chopped herbs); and the fried shrimp are also a very popular option. But regardless of what main you decide on, a platter of cool and creamy spreads is the only accompaniment you’ll need—especially since it’s served with pillows of wonderfully chewy pita that arrives so hot you might burn your fingers ripping into it.
"
518,"Hiding in plain sight, right under the Astoria Boulevard subway stop, is this charming trattoria. Unabashedly proud of its Roman roots, servers and cooks here hail from the famed city, and Chef Antonio Morichini arrives early every morning to make the day’s pasta. He twirls the latter into such rich and delicious creations as creamy carbonara, spicy amatriciana, and zesty cacio e pepe.This neighborhood favorite is particularly ideal for couples, who may split a pasta before digging into rustic braised short ribs set in a pool of Gorgonzola polenta and finished with a flavorful tomato sauce. The wood-burning oven turns out a range of thin, crackling pies, but do save room for the house-made desserts, including tiramisu and nutty pistachio ice cream.
"
519,"This beloved Astoria steakhouse has a lot going for it, but its cause for celebration is that authentic Greek accent that imbues everything here. Excellent quality beef, as in the signature prime “wedge” for two, is dry-aged in-house, charbroiled to exact specification and finished with sea salt and dried oregano. Vibrant starters and sides underscore the Aegean spirit at play with pan-fried vlahotiri cheese, charred octopus with roasted peppers and a red wine dressing, as well as smoked feta-mashed potatoes.Christos has a commanding presence on a quiet tree-shaded corner just off bustling Ditmars Blvd. Mixing shades of brown, the cozy and elegant dining room has a separate bar area and is lined with fish tanks stocked with live lobsters.
"
520,"With the Universal Hip Hop museum located a mile away, Beatstro may just be the epicenter for amazing music, food, and culture. The brainchild of Alfredo Anguiera, and partner Junior Martinez, this is cooking that speaks to the borough's rich Puerto Rican and African-American presence.The entrance foyer features bright green walls and shelves lined with LP’s. Behind the velvet curtain, you’ll find a stylish room donning the artwork of Andre Trenier and photos from local legend, Joe Conzo. Yet, the best part is the food. The menu, complete with a blend of cooking styles, highlights pork rinds with barbecue seasoning and lemon, as well as golden-fried green tomatoes. Save room for the mojo chicken, with roasted potatoes, collard greens, and salsa verde.
"
521,"You will only find happy people here, and the Aegean-blue awning feels as essential to the neighborhood as traffic lights. This beloved Greek spot (with a second location in the East Village) is a lively one where the bustling kitchen is in view. Quick, straightforward servers may address you in Greek if you look the part—that’s just how local it gets here.Grab a seat on the enclosed patio for some serenity and get things going with garlicky and bubbling-hot crab-stuffed clams; or the cold, classic trio of powerful skordalia, cooling tzatziki and briny taramosalata served with toasted pita triangles. Order a side of horta (steamed escarole and dandelion) to accompany a plate of sweet and delicate mullets, served with a side of lemon potatoes.
"
522,"Broadly appealing yet truly unique, Himalayan Yak transports diners from Jackson Heights to Central Asia for a hybrid of Nepalese, Tibetan and Indian cuisines. The room is a bit worn—a testament to its long-standing popularity—but orange walls invoke mountain sunsets. Carved dark wood and colorful fabrics create a far-flung ambience.Start with an order of momo: these steamed minced meat-filled dumplings are seasoned with scallions, cilantro and ginger. Then sample yak in the form of sausage, stew, or cheese. Labsha is a beef and daikon curry served with tingmo, a multi-layered steamed bun for sopping up the mildly spiced sauce, which simply must not be missed. And finally the lassi, a traditional yogurt-based drink, is the perfect complement to every meal.
"
523,"A restaurant with glossy menus featuring page after page of professional photos can often be misleading, as the actual dish usually bears little resemblance. Refreshingly, in the case of this charming Tibetan mainstay, what you see is what you get—and that is good news indeed. Case in point? A wide platter of fried lamb ribs, simply seasoned with salt and pepper, stacked upon each another, and tossed with sautéed peppers. Fried momos may feature a range of fillings, but go with the beef paired with pickled vegetables for a greaseless, yet crispy treat.Fiery chili sauces found on every table promise to crank up the heat and spice. However, comforting staples like Phayul noodle soup or stir-fried beef with laphing are plenty seasoned and amply delicious.
"
524,"There are some cuisines that would buckle under the demands of a vegetarian-only menu, but in Chef Amrit Pal Singh’s no-frills restaurant, plate after plate will demonstrate the real magic of going meatless. Singh, who grew up in Punjab, keeps his Indian menu small, unlike countless other kitchens in bustling Jackson Heights; and everything arrives hot out of the pan.The signature order is dum biryani—of course—capped in a dome of golden-brown pastry and filled with fragrant basmati rice, ginger, caramelized onions, and peas. But best of all might be the house-made paneer khurchan that arrives with a dark, zesty curry of tomatoes and peppers. Like everything else accompanied by sauce, it’s an item that thrives over rice and eats even better the next day.
"
525,"This sweet spot-turned-social justice refuge for immigration and other activists stands out for its authentic Oaxacan food. In fact, it's revered by the neighborhood as a rare dining delight, thanks to a homey and welcoming vibe. Take the owner, for instance, who loves to wax poetic about the traditions behind the regional cooking as well as the history and art, as evidenced by the lending library in the back.Oaxaca is known for its sumptuous moles, so sample the likes of a wonderfully complex red pumpkin seed version (pipián rojo de pepitas) with pork spare ribs, or the glossy mole Oaxaqueño fragrant with cloves, peanuts, chocolate, and served over chicken. Save room for wildly fresh tamales, teeming with chicken, spices, and tomatillo salsa.
"
526,"Longtime fans of the previous tenant (Paet Rio) will be thrilled to know that little has changed under this new name. The interior is still as cozy as ever, like a long train car with wall-to-wall wood paneling and redolent of incense. Service is welcoming and attentive; and the food, most importantly, remains notably appetizing, in an area rich with competing Thai kitchens.The dizzyingly long menu features curries, fried rice, salads, and stir-fries. But look closely and you’ll find real gems, like yum pla duk, or a delicate weave of crispy catfish topped with tangy mango salad. Miang kha-na is an essential starter, mixing lime rinds, pork, and peanuts to brilliant effect. Bright, fiery, sharp, and spicy—this is Thai food in its most captivating form.

527,"Just off the main drag on a residential block in Elmhurst, Pata Cafe is a tidy and convivial haunt run by a mother-daughter team. Planks and beams of unfinished wood along with light fixtures crafted from old soup cans lend to this space a treehouse-cum-workshop vibe. No matter—as all of it simply adds to the overall warmth.Skip the bodega items for sale and scan the short, sweet menu. There is a keen eye for textures, acidity and electric heat here. Order a bowl of tom yum goong with its clear broth and sinus-clearing spice, before slurping up minced chicken-topped glass noodles dressed with a lime-fish sauce. Ga prao kai dow (beef with chili) certainly isn’t anything novel, but fans of this familiar dish will relish the classic rendition on offer here.
"
528,"This tiny, impeccably clean dining room is drawing diners left and right to Elmhurst these days. But wait, you argue—isn’t this just another Chinese joint along a stretch of Broadway? Not quite. In fact, Sweet Yummy House is a diamond in the rough for those hunting down authentic spice levels, as well as Taiwanese specialties they’ve never heard of.A meal here might kick off with a duo of sautéed cabbages, one cooked in a delicate Taiwanese style, the other in the Shanghai tradition, sporting fiery oil. You could also order by temperature from this menu, starting with cold chicken dunked in a red-hot chili sauce, before moving on to sweet, sour, and bitter jelly noodles. Finally, tuck in to home-style lamb for a spicy Sichuan take on pomodoro sauce.
"
529,"The light-filled interior of this Mexican powerhouse sitting on a quiet corner is a busy amalgam of rustic artifacts, wolf taxidermy and the Virgin Mother in all her glory with flowers and votives at her feet. And those huge jars of jamaica, horchata and the agua fresca del dia are just as tasty and refreshing as they are decorative.If they have the tlayuda, order it. Its crunchy paper-thin base is smothered in a veritable fiesta of refried black beans, chicharrón, lettuce, queso Oaxaca, crema and much, much more. Other equally terrific specials have included chivo, a rich goat stew highlighting an intense habanero-spiked consommé or tender lamb barbacoa tacos. Cold accompanying salsas are so divine one could skip the chips and just eat them—with a spoon.
"
530,"If you can't resist that intoxicating blend of good food and great tunes, you’ll want to make a beeline to this fun-loving spot. Here, the passionate and dedicated kitchen team fuses Asian, Latin, and other styles to create an American melting pot menu—and the result is pure bliss. Of course, nightly live music and a hopping dance floor on weekends are just more reasons to get here early.Start with delicious guacamole tucked with juicy mango, before moving on to such hearty items as perfectly charred octopus served over a swish of smoked potato crema with spicy chorizo and black olive chimichurri. Tender and fluffy pork buns paired with dragon salsa is as fresh and fulfilling as the classic lomo saltado, which finds new life with arroz verde.
"
531,"The Bronx is immensely proud of its heritage, but that doesn’t mean it resists change. In fact, this recruit fits in perfectly with the swiftly changing 'hood as it stands sentry at the base of a distinguished building on a prominent corner.The interior is sunny and welcoming with a gracious staff to boot; the menu is melting pot Central America featuring papusas from El Salvador, baleadas from Honduras and enchiladas from Mexico. Go for a side of cheese—the cuajada is a soft curd variety offering a taste of Nicaragua. Tacos, like the enchilada with a spicy pork concoction, are simple but gratifying; while the heartier, fork-tender oxtail floating in an intense sauce with a hint of sweetness embodies the kitchen's complexity of flavors.
"
532,"This Leggett Avenue culinary destination has settled into its bigger and brighter digs. A large door, lofty windows and lush outdoor patio draw passersby galore. Make your way inside to discover a cheerful vibe and smiling servers.This kitchen is almost as large as the dining space itself; and the cooking as warming and memorable as ever. Sidle up to one of the many stools and dig into such soothing delicacies as chicken pozole, composed from supremely tender cacahuazintle kernels. This luscious creation may be followed by the likes of chilaqulies, or crisp corn chips coated with shredded pork, spicy salsa verde, cotija, and crema. There's no going wrong with the mole de Puebla featuring layer upon layer of flavor. And that flan? An expertly made finale.
"
533,"Everyone knows the old adage about being on the right side of the train tracks, but what about being under them? That’s the story of this humble Peruvian cevicheria, set just a few steps north of the John F. Kennedy International Airport. Cushy pillows atop tree trunks act as chairs outside; inside, by the door, speakers blare with Latin beats.No need to debate what to order: leche de tigre is the star, paraded out in a giant martini glass filled with thinly sliced octopus, scallops, shrimp, and set afloat in an electrifying elixir of lime juice and ginger. But perhaps the most surprising dish of all is the pork tamal, hidden away in the corner of the carte. It is presented in a bamboo steamer and highlights the magic that is soft, fluffy masa.
"
534,"Indeed it’s quite easy to miss the front door of this narrow restaurant among the street’s many window displays, but that would be a shame as this Sichuan haunt is a welcome surprise. Cucumbers might be a bizarre reason to travel across town, but here they are tossed with oil steeped in numbing peppercorns, brightened with vinegar, soy, and dried red chilies, and utterly worth it.Diners can choose ingredients to build their own dry-pot, but they’d be missing out on a number of top chef-made creations. Stir-fried lamb aggressively seasoned with cumin, fish fillets sauced with fermented black beans and garnished with green onions, as well as pea shoots expertly sautéed with slivers of garlic are just some of the highlights turned out of this kitchen.
"
535,"This bright, cheerful Mexican gem can be found in the Soundview section of the Bronx, which was once upon a time lined with Italian flags, bakeries and butchers. Today, you’ll find a global collection of restaurants, including south-of-the-border hot spots, pan-African grocery stores, Puerto Rican lechoneras and Dominican diners.Breakfast at El Molcajete kicks off with delicious egg sandwiches, with a Mexican twist. Lunch brings mouthwatering tacos, tortas and cemitas—served with smoky red and spicy green sauces on the side. Don’t miss the sumptuous gordita, a thick masa cake filled with luscious pork and then floated with cilantro, smooth crema and serrano peppers; or the tender cabeza de res (cow head) and gamey barbacoa (barbecue goat) tacos.
"
536,"Windows filled with shiny-skinned and mouth-watering lechòn lure passersby into this long-standing haunt. The front room is minimally adorned and to-go lines are a frequent sight. Snag a seat in the back—where bright walls are flooded with photos—for table service.Reminiscent of this borough's strong Puerto Rican presence, the kitchen is entirely focused on the same nation's comfort food. Begin with morcilla, blood sausage served with rice, chili peppers, tripe, and cilantro; then get down with the succulent pernil, or crisp-roasted pork shoulder. Speaking of, some 30 hogs are delivered here each week and during the holidays, so you can also get an entire cooked pig to go. Close out with complex sopas, like cow’s feet with yucca or asopado de camarones.
"
537,"This iconic kosher deli is still stuffing sandwiches and ladling matzo ball soup (reputed for its healing powers) just as it has for over 50 years. It's like something out of central casting with its neon sign in the front window, mirrors on the walls, slowly roasting hot dogs, and display counter showing off the knishes and latkes.Soulful classics include stuffed veal breast and tongue sandwiches with tangy pickles, but it's positively blasphemous to skip the pastrami sandwich, with layer-upon-layer of warm pastrami shavings piled on soft rye. Some order to go, but a hearty Reuben stacked with mounds of hot corned beef, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing is more enjoyable in a comfortable booth. Slake your thirst with a can of Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray soda.
"
538,"Belmont may more often be linked to Italian-American cooking, but that doesn't mean this Mexican spot is out of place. In fact, this fun and traditional restaurant—the second iteration; the original opened in Castle Hill in 1999— shines bright. Exposed brick, a ceiling capped with three stars, and a semi-open kitchen complete the comfortable scene.Conversation is common between the pleasant servers and diners, including many Fordham University students. Pancita, a spicy tripe stew, is a real eye-opener with its abundance of toasted chilies. The bistec Estrellita is served with a fiery habanero sauce, topped with pico de gallo, and flanked by rice and beans. Flan is a lovely finish—though that generous steak may fulfill even the heartiest appetite.
"
539,"You can’t miss this storied favorite whose design falls somewhere between a chic farmhouse and Mediterranean villa. In fact, Roberto’s bright coral façade instantly alludes to the allegria of this highly regarded retreat.The space is as ideal for groups as it is for a romantic meal. Inside, find a carved-wood bar and generously sized, candlelit tables. Service is on point, not unlike the simple, ample, and fresh Italian cooking—think tubettini con polipo e bave, or pasta tubes tossed in a chunky tomato sauce with grilled octopus, clams, and fava beans. Fresh, sweet, and tender crab may then arrive in a butter-white wine sauce—redolent of garlic, lemon, and parsley—along with a nest of sautéed spinach. Go big or go home, with the pastiera Napoletana.
"
540,"The Albanian presence in the Bronx has steadily grown since the 1990’s, with residential pockets taking root in various neighborhoods throughout. Now, lucky us, comes the delicious food of the motherland—most recently, the hard-to-pronounce-but-so-worth-a-visit, Çka ka Qëllu.Located next to the rear entrance of the Arthur Avenue Retail Market, this dining room is a celebration of all things Albanian—picture glass cases full of intricate regional garb and ornate frames with sepia-toned photos. The food is simple, comforting, and filling—think traditional meatballs (qofte); finger-sized veal sausages (qebapa); or silky cream with polenta (kačamak). The brumat, featuring a number of Albanian specialties, makes for a great introductory course.
"
541,"Despite the borough’s rapid changes, it’s great to see this sweet little trattoria keep things steady. Thanks to exposed brick, whitewashed arches, clean wood tables, and that fiery oven centerpiece, dining here feels like an instant trip to Salerno by way of the Bronx. The inviting space also flaunts warm, courteous service and a regular fan following, so you’ll be lucky to score a seat. They're all here for the southern-leaning fare, which ranges from a roster of irresistible pizzas and paste al cartoccio to deliciously hearty entrées. Speaking of, don't miss the brasato al #Peroni, starring beer-braised short ribs with cherry peppers and gorgonzola dolce.The homestyle food, top wines, and friendly vibe combined makes it a sort of culinary wonderland.
"
542,"Decked out with crimson walls and red-checkered tablecloths, this is the kind of place where diners feel like they’re in on a delicious secret—and that’s no coincidence, as the name is Italian for “between us.”Responsible for this gem's success is Chef/owner Marco Coletta, who runs the place with the precision of an air traffic controller and the passion of an Italian direttore. The sincerity of his cooking shines through in such delights as lasagna and pizzaiola—if it's not on the menu, don't panic, simply ask for it. Other high points include the ultra-light gnocchi di patate in a lamb ragù and trippa alla Romana with a side of bread for sauce sopping. Only a few desserts are on offer, but we recommend a classic finish by way of the ricotta cheesecake.
"
543,"This Flushing spot is well-known for its dim sum and authentic Cantonese cooking. A longtime resident of 39th Avenue, the expansive dining room is outfitted with round, banquet-style tables, bamboo plants, and ornate chandeliers.Let the feasting begin with memorable crab-and-pork soup dumplings, before tasting the likes of steamed rice rolls with honey-roast pork; spareribs with rice starch and black beans; chicken and ham wrapped in yuba; and poached jellyfish with scallions and sesame.The signature Dungeness crab—steamed and stir-fried, and served with Japanese eggplant and garlic—is terrific. Dim sum carts are not paraded all day here, so those seeking the freshest and the best of what this kitchen offers should plan to arrive by 10am on weekdays.
"
544,"Ornate wood-carved screens, heavy Imperial furniture and enormous serving utensils make this the most stylized and grand Sichuan restaurant in town.The menu’s photos simplify ordering from a range of familiar favorites, like the best bean jelly salad around, intensely savory with a good dose of black vinegar and garlicky chili oil. Other inventive (read: unfamiliar) dishes are just as worthwhile, especially that massive platter of gan ma-style stewed pork leg, surrounded by vibrant Chinese greens. While the cuisine strives to showcase subtlety and dimension rather than decimate the palate with spice, rest assured as some items still boast that tongue-numbing tang from Sichuan’s beloved peppercorns. Portions are large so bring a gang.
"
545,"Helen You has a knack for opening restaurants in hard-to-find places, having first made waves from a tiny stall in a now-closed underground food court. In 2014 she traded in those modest digs for this expensive spot—set within the neon-bright Arcadia Mall, amid phone retailers and beauty supply stores. Inside, red booths are equipped with little TV screens displaying the specials, but regulars already know what they’re here for. Dumplings, of course, and the menu offers a dizzying number of these steamed and fried parcels. Essential dishes include the refreshing lamb and squash; intensely spicy hot and sour beef; and practically anything pan-fried.The restaurant’s rising popularity has spawned talks of franchise opps both in and outside the city.
"
546,"Unlike many other spicy retreats, DaXi Sichuan doesn’t always go for the jugular with that tongue-numbing one-two punch. Instead, this elegant spot on the second floor of the New World Mall shares a more nuanced approach to regional Chinese cuisine—imagine slivers of cold marinated duck in a pool of fiery chili-infused oil. Other dishes, like the pig ear and wild mushroom or cucumber roll showcase subtle flavors, while Tibet-style pork ribs dusted with peppercorns are tender and juicy. Even the straightforward house special, featuring a mix of fluffy rice, pork and potatoes, is known to satisfy many an appetite.Service is sporadic and at times food arrives at lightning speed, but on its best days, this kitchen is capable of delicious work.
"
547,"This ""kitchen"" is a truly unique culinary retreat, set across from Van Cortlandt Park, typically mobbed by golfers, tennis players, and cricketers. Sporting signage designed by Milton Glaser (one of his last works), this neat and colorful interior has tasteful artwork, limited seats, and an open kitchen.A native of Peru, Chef Claudia Berroa follows a preservative-free dictum, so diners may expect a plethora of local and organic flavors. Savory empanadas, like chicken, lomo saltado, aji de gallina or verde chorizo, are impossible to resist. So go for broke and sample them all, with a side of crispy yucca fries or causa rellena. Desserts shine just as bright with the chef's famous and fast-selling flans, starring passion fruit, vanilla and pumpkin.
"
548,"Everything about Alley 41 is unexpected—starting with the moment you walk in to a very sleek and stylish room carefully designed to balance concrete slabs, black wood chairs and glass panes beneath the spotlights. The setting is highly stylized, and the Sichuan cooking is just as appealing. Dishes can sometimes arrive at lightning speed, sometimes not.Leave yourself plenty of time to peruse the mammoth menu, decked with glossy photos to get you in the mood for serious slurping. Imagine an intensely savory and spicy mung bean jello salad and you’ll start to get the picture. Even anodyne dishes like mapo tofu or braised beef and vegetable vermicelli are wickedly spicy, but they bring a complex heat, layered with a funky, sour broth and chilies.
"
549,"While the city may be chock-a-block with steakhouses, it's hard to argue with this gem's deft cooking. Duck behind the limestone facade and you’ll find a clubby, multi-level space with private nooks, a lively, well-stocked bar, flat-screens displaying the latest games and an upstairs wall of windows overlooking Van Cortlandt Park.A true American steakhouse ought to have a substantial shrimp cocktail, and at Jake’s this classic starter arrives fresh and delicious with the sweetness of plump shrimp offset by a tangy cocktail sauce. Any steak on the menu can be topped with Gorgonzola and a thatch of frizzled fried onions, though a succulent and well-marbled T-bone seared to rosy-pink perfection begs for little beyond a fork, knife and good conversation.
"
550,"Despite the array of dining options offered in the Bronx, Beccofino stands apart from the borough's ho-hum standard. In fact, patrons from far and wide routinely pack this spot in posh little Riverdale for its delicious, American-leaning Italian cuisine. Exposed brick walls, rustic terra-cotta floors and white deli paper-covered tables lend a homey setting, where the specials are handwritten and then tucked inside the regular menu.The kitchen creates each plate with great care and portions are generous. Stuffed mushrooms, bound by garlic, parsley and breadcrumbs, are forever earthy; while a glossy, tomato-based risotto with shrimp, clams and lobster is luxury on a plate. Veal with a sherry-shallot demi-glace is so exemplary that you won't miss dessert.
"
551,"This beloved Queens institution enjoys fine digs where they serve popular and praiseworthy Korean food. The contemporary dining room is spacious and airy, with the warm, always informative staff buzzing from table to table. It’s not uncommon for the manager to roll up her own sleeves when the pace elevates—and elevate it does, for this is not your average Korean barbecue.It’s hard to go wrong on Hahm Ji Bach’s delightful menu, but don’t miss the samgyeopsal, tender slabs of well-marinated pork belly sizzled to crispy perfection tableside for you to swaddle in crisp lettuce with paper-thin daikon radish, spicy kimchi and bright scallions; or the mit bachan, a hot clay pot with soft steamed eggs, kimchi, tofu, pickled cucumbers and spicy mackerel.
"
552,"Much more than a neighborhood staple, Patricia’s is an elegant restaurant committed to the convivial spirit of Southern Italy. Its seasonal fare is served in a gracious, brick-lined dining room among white tablecloths, chandeliers and the warmth of a wood-burning oven. That brick oven churns out pleasing pizzas with lightly charred crusts, like the Regina simply adorned with buffalo mozzarella, torn basil and a drizzle of excellent olive oil. Spaghetti Frank Sinatra is a stain-making bowl of slippery pasta loaded with shrimp, clams, olives and capers in chunky tomato sauce.A light touch is seen in the grilled vegetables, topped with paper-thin cremini mushrooms. Don’t miss the flaky and gently poached baccalà alla Livornese in a sharp, tangy sauce.
"
553,"What’s the X factor at this long-standing French-inspired restaurant? The striking views of the Hudson River, of course. It took many months to bring this Yonkers Pier back to life and it now serves as a picturesque perch for this all-glass space. If the twinkling lights of the Palisades aren’t enough, the bejeweled crowd that holds court is equally dazzling. Start with a seafood crêpe stuffed with lobster, shrimp, scallop and crab with sauce Américaine. The menu is largely European-influenced, but Chef Peter Xaviar Kelly spans the globe by way of items like pan-roasted Long Island duck breast seasoned with togarashi and served with a confit duck leg fried rice. Red velvet cake with mascarpone frosting and crème anglaise is a classic ending. 
"
554,"Not to be confused with an unrelated spot on Arthur Avenue, this rather polished and airy restaurant has its own distinct personality. Its loyal local following means that weekend waits are to be expected; and the warm aura heightened by spot-on service seems to welcome everyone like family.Inspired by the Italian-American passion for gathering at the table, Enzo’s offers the kind of cooking that revolves around long-simmered meat sauces and myriad interpretations of house-made pasta. Yet the kitchen knows just how to break a few rules, as seen in the spicy and creamy penne alla vodka. Other highlights include perfectly cooked chicken scarpariello made with dark, juicy morsels of bone-in meat married with a bit of garlic, wine and excellent olive oil.
"
555,"Murray Hill is no stranger to Korean food, but this prized, pig-loving barbecue destination is always packed. Inside, the bright room’s décor forgoes all frills to focus on regional specialties. Smiling servers are earnest and hospitable.Begin with the usual but very exquisite banchan-like pickled turnips, fermented bean paste soup and specially aged house kimchi—funky, garlicky and a total pleasure. The kimchi pancake has a delightfully delicious crust and sear that recalls a slice of pizza. Yet what makes this place unique is that barbecue grill on each table, used for sizzling slices of flavorful duck with miso, garlic cloves and bean sprouts; spicy, tender bits of octopus; and sweet, fatty pork with soy sauce, red chili paste and scallions.
"
556,"There is so much to love here, where sharply dressed servers dish up equal parts warmth, hospitality and steaming bowls of pasta. The menu leans heavily towards that nostalgic sort of red-sauce, Italian-American cooking that is again finding more and more respect, thanks to mouthwatering dishes like merluzzo marechiaro and veal scaloppini.The interior is lovely, which is particularly important since you’re in for a bit of a wait (everything is made fresh to order). But who would complain when fluffy knobs of potato gnocchi arrive tossed in basil pesto with Gorgonzola cheese and walnuts. Chicken scarpariello is perfectly caramelized, deeply flavored and bathed in a sinfully rich wine broth, fragrant with rosemary.
"
557,"A gathering place for Greeks and non-Greeks alike, this family-run and friendly restaurant tempts with impeccably fresh fish, cooked over charcoal and basted simply with olive oil, lemon juice and herbs. Beyond the whitewashed exterior and dark blue awning is a large dining room with rows of neat tables for indulging in Hellenic pleasures—from zesty appetizers to boisterous conversations.Settle into an array of pikilia; cold appetizers such as melitzansalata, eggplant whipped with herbs and olive oil. Chargrilled fish, priced by the pound, has a delightfully smoky essence and moist flesh. Whole smelts are a rare and traditional treat, simply pan-fried with a lemony-herb dressing. Finish with a choice of authentic, nutty and syrup-soaked pastries.
"
558,"Deep into Queens past Flushing is this little gem that hides in plain sight—inside of an ordinary strip mall. To be clear though, the cooking is anything but ordinary. The uninitiated come for the crab Rangoon, General Tso’s chicken, and other American treasures; but those in the know come for crave-worthy Sichuan food.Start with the spicy mung bean jelly noodles and Sichuan-style crispy eggplant, which is not the least bit greasy and sports a creamy center and glass-like crust. Thin shavings of intensely smoked pork with garlic leaf is even better than what tea-smoked duck would taste like if made with bacon. The “tears in eyes” jelly salad may not induce actual tears, but it’s stocked with chillies, seeds, peanuts and is absolutely worth ordering.
"
559,"Westchester is clearly upping its culinary game and attracting real talent. Case in point: this gleaming gem of a spot, headed by Paul DiBari. An citywide mover and shaker, he and Bronx-born sous chef, Michael Stellato, are spearheading this contemporary, focused kitchen and stellar beverage selection.Find a seat at the marble bar and watch the magic unfold. Soft jazz fills the air, as highly civilized servers deliver your fare. Hand-cut maltagliati with ricotta, tomatoes, and basil; brasato di spalla di manzo braised in red wine with mascarpone polenta; or rillettes de cochon with pork confit are just some of the feats. The blood orange-olive oil cake is a rich finale; teas from Bel­locq Tea Atelier are less decadent but dazzling all the same.
"
560,"City Island is lauded for its fresh seafood, breezy style and classic New England vibe. Amidst this scene, discover Archie's—a small space that's simply decorated but ultra warm and inviting.In this kitchen, Chef Alex Pertsovsky devotes his time to cooking with seasonally appropriate ingredients, and correspondingly, his gastropub-inspired menu is full of affordable, top-quality fare. On the one hand there are crispy chipotle-honey chicken wings with Maytag blue cheese dip and wild salmon with cabbage fried rice, while the Detroit pizza is an homage to the years he spent in the Midwest. Desserts, like the sublime banana cream pie, are deserving of your time—and appetite. Order a second one to go if you're so inclined (and you will be). 
"
561,"Welcome to this dark, moody, and stylish retreat, where the only thing better than its ace ingredients is the delicious manner in which they are prepared. Set beside Bow Tie Cinemas, one of Bronxville's most beloved art houses, the tasteful space dons velvet wallpaper, splashes of red, and shimmering silver. The fact that it's packed with locals along with servers who know your name simply adds to that sense of conviviality. Over in the kitchen, the chef fearlessly delivers a varied selection of dishes finished with flair. Nibble on a cool artichoke salad tossed with Sicilian olive oil, lemon, and coarse salt; before digging into a wholesome panko-coated, milk-fed veal Parmigiana. Close out with cookies and cream for a bit of a sweet and bountiful joy.
"
562,"It’s a cute neighborhood spot yet this restaurant far exceeds what might be expected with cooking that goes completely outside of the box. It’s why every seat is almost always filled with young couples, families and regulars. Artisanal products are given the royal treatment here, and the house-made mozzarella is the stuff of dreams. All of the appetizers are excellent and rotating daily specials are always worth a second look. Linguine tossed with olive oil, pepper and lemon rind is simple, but spot-on, while the fusilli con pomodoro fra diavolo packs an excellent, chili-infused punch. Salty-sweet-smoky cabbage is just brilliant when accompanying that juicy half chicken a la plancha.  Look to the specials for the best desserts.   
"
563,"Nestled along New Rochelle's more commercial streets, Dubrovnik is a real find—with the added bonus of live Croatian music on certain nights. Diners come from near and far to feast on their myriad of items from the wood-burning oven. Equally appealing is the interior design. Next door to the owner’s cabinetry business, everything here is custom-made. Attention to detail isn’t just a hallmark of their décor though; the menu follows close at hand, offering the likes of a Dalmatian platter with artisanal charcuterie; and crni rižoto, tender cuttlefish risotto. Orata grilled over wood charcoal is simply perfect, but those palačinke (crêpes with peach jam) result in sweet dreams.Even the wine list, starring Croatian and other varietals, bear the owner's stamp.
"
564,"Chef Michael Psilakis puts the ""MP"" in this taverna, serving his modern interpretation of Greek cuisine. Just steps from Hudson River, enter through the sleek bar area to arrive inside this 18th-century structure, with rustic brass chandeliers, mahogany panels, and neutral hues mixed with pops of blue. Whether seated at a booth, banquette or table, diners can count on family-style plates.Start with meze, like tzatziki imbued with fresh dill, before savoring mains like gently roasted chicken sporting perfectly crisp skin or aged grilled sausage with a hint of orange peel. Desserts, too, flaunt a contemporary twist, as in a whopping slice of galaktoboureko. Groups should go for the the chef's whole roast animal, but call ahead as it takes time to prep.
"
565,"With a family whose restaurant roots are one for the books, it's no surprise to find that Chef/owner Chas Anderson is behind this Eastchester swart. Burrata is busy at all times for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which is the chef's ability to create gorgeous, flavorful food. Even the open-floor design, with windows aplenty and oyster-tinted walls, is fresh and inviting.Thanks to the use of top-shelf ingredients and a wood-burning oven, this is a menu of seasonal marvels. Squash soup with toasted pumpkin seeds is comfort in a bowl, as are veal polpettine with robiolina cheese and tomato sauce. Pastas and pizzas are impossible to resist. Go big with rigatoni enriched by Rohan duck ragù and porcini mushrooms; or go home with a crowning Margherita pie.
"
566,"This longstanding restaurant in idyllic Irvington is a rather special place. Tucked along Main Street and framed by windows, it is bright and welcoming, thanks to mustard-yellow walls, art and photos aplenty, as well as hand-blown glass light fixtures. A small, inlaid-tile bar out front welcomes one and all to dine on a wonderful, flavor-rich carte from Chef/co-owner Navjot Arora. Local, organic produce star in such complex, boldly spiced dishes as bhindi masala (imbued with tangy amchoor) and Punjabi eggplant curry. Chana masala reaches delicious heights when paired with a sweet and nutty Peshawari naan.Chutneys are clearly the star here. Case in point—mango and tamarind. They're so luscious, they may as well be jarred and sold for posterity.
"
567,"Husband and wife team, Scott and Pastry Chef Heather Fratangelo, are the brains behind this lovely Italian spot. Simple and demure from the outside, there's something special about this dining room that's perceptible instantly upon entry. Smiling servers guide you to a simple yet comfortable table, framed by bistro seats. Bright unframed paintings adorn the walls, while shelves are lined with canning jars.The menu's chosen language may be Italian but it never strays too far from its American roots. Start with a summer salad of cantaloupe, stone fruit and feta, before indulging in such fine pastas as bucatini with cherry tomatoes, roasted garlic and Parmigiana. Thanks to the ace pastry chef, desserts—like the elaborate cookie board—are not to be missed.
"
568,"Boasting a rustic and sleek interior, this signora makes a pretty perch for drinking and dining. Midnight-blue leather banquettes, chandeliers and exposed brick adorn the room; a long bar is populated by chatty locals and well-heeled visitors.While the kitchen sticks to beloved Italian classics, it also pivots seamlessly towards a more contemporary approach. Burrata, for instance, is first fried and then dressed to the nines with roasted pomodorini and pistachio. Linguine tossed with favas, peas and fennel pesto is a springtime treat, while monkfish with creamy bisque and soppressata is ideal at all times.Desserts, like the dannolo, is a delicious hybrid of the classic cannoli filled with cream, chocolate chips and crowned by a tiny round of biscotti. 
"
569,"This destination-worthy dining room is coveted for its idyllic setting. Imagine sprawling estate grounds with a carriage house, cottage, and two historic, freshly minted mansions. One of these is a large event space; the other is Goosefeather. Here, guests are greeted by well-appointed nooks, all blending old-fashioned charm with new-world elements—like lights, color, and crystal.The menu is surprisingly unforgettable as conceived by Dale Talde. Known for his craft with Hong Kong-style food, the talented chef infuses these staples with a modern, seasonal twist. From succulent Cantonese roast duck and steamed branzino, this is cooking that comforts and delights. Desserts too, as in the chocolate mousse tart with salted crema and hazelnuts, follow suit.
"
570,"Looking for a truly warm and expansive spot serving special Italian cuisine? Come to this rustic-chic café, prettified with double-height ceilings, exposed wooden beams, and an ample bar. There are two rooms, each long and narrow but wonderfully comfortable and always abuzz. Beautiful flower arrangements and large-format wine bottles put patrons in a specially festive mood.Thoughtfully arranged tables may be cradled with such impressively rich plates as sformatino di melanzane in a tomato-cream sauce crowned with burrata; followed by rigatoni al pomodoro, underscoring sweet and tart tomato sauce, basil, and EVOO. The Milanese with a wedge of lemon and freshly cracked black pepper is a textbook instance of simplicity being the peak of this elegant cooking.
"

Under the watchful eye of Hassan Jarane, who hails from Morocco, it features a retail area up front teeming with food from around the world. Further along the deep and narrow space, find exposed brick walls, antique artifacts, and a smattering of tables.The semi-open kitchen turns out a menu that meanders around the Mediterranean, resulting in hearty seafood, savory steaks, and charcuterie aplenty. Nibble on crispy falafel as you peruse the board for such indulgent specials as the grilled Porterhouse accompanied by a simple salad. English cheddar with caramelized onions and balsamic vinegar is a popular proxy for dessert.

572,"Find this inviting gem tucked into a mini shopping mall in tony Scarsdale. Meritage is comfortable with neutral hues, softly dressed windows and artwork by locals from around the way. Perhaps out of view from the plush dining room, one can still hear the bar buzzing with happy regulars. Adorned with linen and wild flowers, tables may also feature such seasonal and locally minded delights as the chicken liver crostini. This workhorse of a dish is made ultra rich thanks to the addition of soft onions and toasted hazelnuts. Similarly, tagliatelle is tossed with slow-cooked ragù Bolognese, creamy ricotta and herbs for a delicious feast.Budget-conscious diners should go for the prix-fixe dinner on weekdays and Sunday suppers, as they are a sweet deal.
"
573,"Set within a stand-alone building, there is a large, compelling sign marking the entrance to this contemporary gem. Make your way inside to find a melange of such rustic-chic decorative elements as weathered wood floors, matching beams across a white-vaulted ceiling, muted walls, and toasty fireplace. If that dosen't sound inviting enough, look to its Sichuan food, focused on quality ingredients, balanced spices, and harmonious flavors.Speaking of, stir-fried lotus root accompanied by scallion shavings brims with crunch and freshness, while dry pepper chicken mingled with garlic, red chilies, and Sichuan peppercorn brings the heat and all the feels. Sweeten the deal with a rich, savory, and toothsome rendition of eggplant stir-fried with garlic and soy.

574,"This ambitious and sleek Elmsford spot is the very image of verve and vitality. Those who arrive with time to spare may browse the wares at the Mediterranean market next door, before making their way into the mid-century modern space, featuring mirrored walls and shades of white and grey. Beloved by large groups and starry-eyed duos, linen-covered tables set the stage for a parade of ingredients that may be unfamiliar but are essential to an authentic Persian feast.The olivieh salad, with chicken, potatoes and feta- and walnut-stuffed dates, makes a great first bite. Kashk-e-bademjoon may follow, starring fried eggplant with onion, garlic and whey; while roasted lamb with dill and fava beans delivers on aroma and flavor—and is every carnivore's dream.
"
575,"Fine Indian cooking has landed in Elmsford, thanks to this grey-and-white jewel box. Chef Peter Beck is a consultant on the menu, and thanks to his impressive culinary background, it is a bright, refined, and expansive carte that meanders through the myriad Indian regions. Coconut rice, garlic naan, and raita make delicious accompaniments to the likes of garlicky lasoni gobi; patili ka keema (ground, boldly seasoned lamb redolent of nutmeg); and Hyderabadi lamb shank in a lusciously spiced onion- tomato- and coconut milk-sauce.If that doesn't leave you wanting more, desserts like kulfi falooda garnished with vermicelli, tapioca seeds and rose syrup, will do the trick. Drinks are equally strong, but there's no going wrong with the creamy mango lassi. 
"
576,"Its stark exterior does not hint at the warm vibe or enticing bites, bound to tempt even the most stoic eater here. One glance around this buzzy and well-appointed dining room proves that it is cherished by multi-generational groups. The setting paints an intriguing picture, thanks to sleek, intricately carved wooden panels, tables, chairs, and vivid artwork. Semi-private booths are ingeniously lit, and ergo, most popular.The menu boasts a litany of delightful appetizers, like tender soup dumplings. Classics—like garlic-pepper shrimp with leeks and celery—are prepared with exacting technique and deliver wonderful flavor. Slow-cooked Peking duck is a sensory thrill, served with soft pancakes and all the fixings—think cucumber, scallions and hoisin sauce.
"
577,"Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture sets the national conversation for healthy and sustainable food systems. It's a conversation that carries onto the plate at its signature, world-class restaurant. The tasting menu offered here echoes the farm’s seasonal best and might very well change the way you think about food.Culinary wunderkind Dan Barber has become a global icon for his zero-waste philosophy, which is expressed all the way down to the bone ash china gracing the tables and kitchen scraps transformed into charcoal. The capacious dining room, formerly a dairy barn, features dark wood beams and pale walls that take on a warm glow. Artful arrangements of flowers and vegetables create a near-theatrical rendering of the land's power and presence.Meals begin with an onslaught of clever bites, mostly vegetables plucked from the property's greenhouses and working farm. The kitchen infuses even the most unlikely ingredients with magic, like zesty green gazpacho paired with surf clam and radicchio; or dry-aged golden beet ""steak"" adorned with beef-studded jus. A block of Stone Barns honey semifreddo with strawberry compote brings the kitchen's farm-to-fork mantra full circle. 
"
578,"The name says it all here, as this was once a private residence. It shares a farm charm, from walls hung with repurposed wood shutters to shelves stacked with Americana bric-à-brac. Families flock here, so if the noise is too much, head outdoors to the lovely patio. The menu is loaded with American dishes that have an Italian bent. There are plenty of winners, like polenta crowned with chicken scarpariello, which in turn is punched up with spicy pickled red and green cherry peppers and crispy Italian sausage. Naturally, pizzas are ever-popular, as are those delicious eggplant meatballs.Just a few bites of the butterscotch pudding are bound to satisfy your sweet tooth. Besides, you can walk it off at the nearby Silver Lake Preserve. 
"
579,"Just a few bites of this food and you might think you’re in Dixie—it's that convincing. Polished concrete floors, steel chairs and whitewashed brick walls emblazoned with animal silhouettes set a modern country look, and the open kitchen’s cacophony is part of the fun. From grits bowls to fixin’s, this menu is littered with winning renditions of Southern classics. Watermelon salad, shrimp and grits, shrimp jambalaya and pulled pork sandwiches are good bets, but don’t even think about starting a meal here without the cheddar biscuits. Bourbon-glazed donuts or key lime cheesecake keep with the theme at dessert. The communal table requires advanced notice and at least eight guests—to share a suckling pig with all the fixin’s or Cajun-style seafood boil. 
"
580,"Despite all signs, this isn't so much a Japanese haunt as much as it is the chef's own interpretation of the same nation's cuisine. The light-filled space hums with an attractive crowd, including locals who convene—under a lofty ceiling—at the welcoming bar. If that doesn't scream neighborhood jewel, an open kitchen offering creative bites is sure to fill the bill.A far cry from the restaurants of its native Japan, this contemporary operation features everything from nigiri, sashimi and handrolls, to tempura and hot dishes. Madeira-miso black cod as well as crab-and-pork dumplings are favorites; but diners should also try such specials as Maine bluefin topped with scallion, wild hirame brushed with white soy, or even Hokkaido uni shot with Osetra caviar. 
"
581,"This charming haven, nestled on a bustling strip in bucolic Rye, is flanked by ritzy fashion boutiques, jewelry stores, and restaurants galore. Inside, it paints the very picture of a chic Parisian brasserie, complete with brass accents, sleek wood floors, gleaming mirrors, and an impressively stocked bar.The food, albeit straightforward, is authentic, expertly prepared, and well-priced. Seafood is a clear focus, with raw bar staples alongside  French favorites. From the colossal crab cocktail and soothing New England clahohowder, to roasted diver scallops with a sweet corn and tomato risotto, every item is a guranteed hit. Hearty steak frites cater to the carnivores, while warm chocolate sauce-enrobed profiteroles will leave you with dreams of sweet. 
"
582,"A culmination of Chefs Raffaele Ronca and Owner Ann Mara Cacase's vision, this inviting operation fits swimmingly along ritzy Purchase Street. Step inside to be greeted by a long, marble bar—ideal for dining or good,  old-fashioned drinking. Behind, is an open kitchen with a commanding oven. While a spuntino of caponata with focaccia makes a welcome starter, specials like fried squash blossoms filled with truffle goat cheese will have your serotonin levels rising. Pastas are a worthy option, as in the lobster ravioli with cream sauce or seafood-studded schizzetto—a veritable ensemble of spaghetti tossed with white wine, garlic, as well as the pulp from sweet and tart cherry tomatoes. Sit by the enclosed wine wall to watch the sommelier earn his stripes.
"
583,"Mount Kisco locals are rejoicing at the arrival of this impossibly delicious Georgian ""kitchen"" as well as the new culinary dialect that accompanies it. This is a simple, welcoming dining room with a trestle-like ceiling, soft Edison light bulbs, and dark wood bar. A flat-screen showing the regional highlights of Georgia merely puts patrons in the mood for good food.Pkhali rolls kick things off, where eggplant is stuffed with zucchini, peppers, and topped with pomegranate seeds—the latter an ideal counterpoint to the rich ingredients. Mini khinkali (beef, veal, and pork dumplings in a yogurt sauce) are in fact bold and hearty; while shkmeruli, or slow-roasted Cornish hen, in a garlic-cream sauce is best sopped up by that most cheesy of breads—imeruli.
"
584,"Set 90 minutes from DC in a town whose very existence seems tied to the restaurant, this is a destination in every sense of the word. Embellished to the very last inch, the dining room resembles a jewel box lined with patterned carpets, lush wallpaper and shimmering fabrics.The restaurant may be over 40 years old, but Chef Patrick O’Connell’s cuisine shines as brightly as ever. Each menu has a unique focus, as in the “Gastronaut"" and “The Good Earth,” offering superb vegetarian items. Guests can also graze through the menus to get a full sense of what the team can do. Sauces work a particular magic, as evidenced by the truffle-infused tartar with morel “crabcake.” Desserts, like coconut sorbet with ginger granité, are perfection.
"
585,"This is ""casual"" as done by the meticulous chef Patrick O'Connell (of the Inn at Little Washington) whose latest project is a cafe and bakery located in a converted 1950s garage. The setting now sports a white-painted brick exterior and al fresco dining; while inside it's all country chic with an inviting marble bar counter, cozy wood tables, beamed ceiling and walls enhanced with still life canvases - all warmed by a stone-fronted fireplace.The menu offers broad appeal and all of it is executed with finesse. A sandwich of shaved Champagne-brined ham and Comté cheese on a pillowy onion roll is a lovely midday meal; while Julia Child's beef Bourguignon is a tempting option come dinnertime. Treat yourself anytime with sweets from the bakery, like the wedge of bourbon chocolate pecan pie.
"
586,"""Modern farmhouse"" might just be the most apt description for Christina and Matt Safarowic's welcoming Katonah operation. It also happens to be one of the more popular spots in town with a buzzy bar to boot. Ingredients from local farms and artisans inform the menu, where you’ll find tender meats, excellent cheeses, breads and terrifically fresh vegetables. Order the everything deviled eggs for a creamy-delicious bite, though the burrata and heirloom tomato panzanella is just as drool-worthy. The lobster BLT is complete with candied bacon bits; try the juicy Berkshire pork chop; or twirl your fork in the spaghetti tossed with shrimp and chilies. Bread pudding with a Bourbon-salted caramel sauce makes that wait worth it, since there are no reservations.  
"
587,"While the eponymous inn is a luxurious retreat in itself, it is Chef Roxanne Spruance's farmhouse set within that steals the show. Her menu, replete with compelling flavors, is a great chaperone to the space's rich and updated design. A sweeping bar along with American walnut tables, cross-backed chairs, and brass light fixtures await patrons in the dining room; while the trestled terrace is a welcoming outdoor treat. This kitchen is all about inventive and contemporary cooking, starting with a winning sequence of salt cod-and-potato fritters accompanied by sauce gribiche. Seared striped bass with roasted, whipped Japanese eggplant and a ""salad"" of snap peas may then be bookended by cherry clafoutis and amaretto ice cream for a bit of bright summer fun.
"
588,"This warm and inviting Victorian-style inn exemplifies country charm. After a glimpse of the valet line and attractive white clapboard façade, it’s quite obvious that this restaurant is for a pedigreed crowd. Manicured gardens complete the picture. The mien may be rustic, but the menu conceived by Chef de Cuisine Ron Gallo is utterly contemporary. It features a veritable hit list of Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s greatest dishes, albeit in tweaked formats. The classic tuna ribbons from the chef's eponymous Manhattan outpost inspires this kitchen's tuna tartare with avocado, ginger-soy sauce, and chili oil. Crisp, pan-roasted salmon is then set in a fragrant corn-lime broth. Finish with ripe strawberries, meringue kisses, and a sour cream-poppy seed sorbet.
"
589,"With its charming front porch and big glossy windows that flood the dining space with light, dining here can feel like eating at a good friend’s home. The super-friendly staff and lively bar, where everyone seems to want to get to know you, only elevates the overall sense of bonhomie. Then there’s the possibility of live music and patio seating come summertime—it's hard not to love this ""star.""You may be caught off guard then, when the kitchen manages to so deftly mix local, organic ingredients into a next-level lineup of New American fare, like comforting turkey meatloaf or grilled swordfish paired with artichoke purée, fingerling potatoes and kale. Desserts are unskippable, especially the chocolate brioche bread pudding, drizzled with hazelnut sauce.
"
590,"Plenty of places talk about farm to table cuisine but what about a table at the farm? Purdy’s does just that with its darling white farmhouse with picturesque views of the farm. It’s not just cute—this restaurant walks the walk by using ingredients they grow, smoke or cure on site. From the house-made hot sauce to the carrot bread, thoughtful details are everywhere. Scallop “salad” features three perfectly seared scallops set with farm bacon and a fried egg. The strawberry and crème ice cream cake’s four bright pink layers are not only beautiful, but delicious. Even cocktails are inspired by their great outdoors—the pea martini with cucumber and elderflower is a refreshing change of pace. Stop in to the farm shop next door before heading home. 
"
591,"Occupying a corner of Hyde Park within view of the University of Chicago, this is an inviting retreat with a welcoming bar, striking dining room, and buzzy kitchen helmed by the very talented Erick Williams. His well-executed Southern cooking draws a smart crowd, largely from the university nearby.For starters, imagine skillet corn bread with a steak knife for slicing and slathering on the honey butter, while dirty rice topped with chicken gizzards is just what the soul ordered. Don’t miss the butcher’s snack, a selection of house-made charcuterie with pepper jelly. Southerners seek out the Geechie Boy grits with white cheddar for a stone-ground taste of home, but ganache-filled chocolate cake with Bourbon cherries will have dessert fans back in no time. 
"
592,"The name of this delicious Hyde Park offering belongs to chef and owner, Nella Grassano, a classically trained pizzaiola. Together with her restaurateur partner, Francesco, the couple’s warm hospitality is the icing on the cake to an experience built around solid cooking. Favorite items include house-made pasta, laced with pristine ingredients and cooked to al dente perfection; or blistered Neapolitan pies, so fresh and authentic they’ll transport you straight to the Italian countryside.Don’t sleep on the starters though, like calamari affogati braised to perfection in a spicy tomato sauce studded with salt-brined black olives. Sop up the incredible sauce with Grassano’s lip-smacking bread, baked in-house and served warm from the wood-burning oven.
"
593,"Flaunting a fantastic location, right by the McCormick Place Convention Center, the design of this dining room conceived by Chef Stephen Gillanders' wife, Seon Kyung Yuk, is cool and chic. The space is vast and ceilings are sky high. A glass façade ensures that it's engulfed by natural light.Over in the kitchen, the chef is the kingpin and may be found shuffling between the wood-burning oven and serene counter. His cooking is straightforward, exemplary, and poised for sharing. Puffy bread with truffle, garlic, and cheese; or a wedge salad with tomatoes and boquerones deliver on all flavor fronts. Close at hand are such hearty pastas as bucatini with spicy pomodoro. Save room for dessert, as Pastry Chef Tatum Sinclair is perpetually turning out delightful treats.

594,"Whether you’re taking in the modern masterpieces at The Art Institute or simply enjoying lunch and cocktails on the sculpture-filled garden terrace, Terzo Piano is a feast for all the senses. The windowed room is mod and minimalist, allowing the artistry of the Mediterranean-influenced menu to shine brightly at each table. Italian elements too find their way into many seasonal dishes, thanks to this rather versatile kitchen team. Charred tomato crème fraîche lends luxurious smokiness and a tart flavor to tender chicken Milanese resting on a roasted cipollini purée. And agnolotti bursting with a sweet pea-ricotta filling find a savory balance with shards of crispy pancetta.As an added bonus, museum members receive a 10 percent discount on their meal.
"
595,"Set on the 18th floor of a medical center, guests are welcomed into this restaurant by warm leather banquettes and cool marble tables. If that doesn't scream conviviality, look out for the buzzing crowds and wall of suspended wine bottles. This is an elegant and panoramic dining room, surrounded by a host of high-rises. Settle in for a spread of family-style plates. There's the requisite burger, but dishes also flaunt a great deal of ingenuity. Sample contemporary twists on American classics, whereby buffalo wing flavors are re-imagined in the ""chicken chicharrón"" with bright orange powder-dusted rice crisps and blue cheese foam. Such showmanship reaches a peak over cocktails, lit on fire, and desserts like the chocolate pot de crème smoked at the table.
"
596,"Nosh on a mile-high sandwich or chocolate malt at this revival of the classic delicatessen. Subway tiles are a wonderful contrast against retro leather booths, while jazz plays in the background and keeps things flowing with chutzpah and flair.This menu offers ""super clean"" vegetarian and vegan selections, like the Veggie Reuben; Eleven Impossible burger; and even the Veggie Star magic shroom. ""Mrs. Goldfarb's Unreal Deli"" indeed offers that unreal combo of vegan corned beef, avocado, cole slaw, and rye; along with other standouts like patty melts, knishes, latkes, and—no prizes for guessing—Bubbie’s chicken soup with a baseball-sized matzo ball. A triple-decker wedge of red velvet or Junior's cheesecake will have those Brooklyn fans returning for more.
"
597,"Though the casual dining movement seems unstoppable, this elegant holdout still likes to kick it old school. Here, along with classical French cuisine, guests are also treated to suited waiters and cart brigade service. In fact, this quaint two-story townhouse, set in the heart of Streeterville and decked out with throw pillow-lined banquettes, fresh-flower arrangements and an upstairs tea salon, makes for the perfect backdrop. Just past the entrance, find a small parlor and polished bar, which also doubles as a fine perch for a pre-dinner martini in an etched glass.Come dinnertime, diners look forward to a prix-fixe menu that allows them to choose between various courses, including an ahi tart, warming mushroom soup and sweet Grand Marnier soufflé.
"
598,"Despite its location in the Museum of Contemporary Art, Marisol is so much more than a museum food court. This restaurant takes its name from the late French pop art sculptor, whose work was the museum’s first acquisition.The local, seasonal, and sensible cooking appeals to all palates, though much of the menu focuses on vegetables. Start with the burrata, a ubiquitous dish ramped up here with blood orange segments, almond crumble, and vanilla oil. This kitchen grills a perfect steak sided by cauliflower in a bright and flavorful huckleberry vinaigrette. The earthy buttermilk rye cake is expertly balanced by creamy pumpkin mousse and a quenelle of Mexican hot chocolate ice cream. Hit the Counter for coffee, pastries, and quick bites on the go.  
"
599,"For more than a decade, this expansive, eclectic gastropub has catered to the Millennium Park crowds. Handsome banquettes and columns wrapped in celadon tiles lend a clubby allure, but the space’s buzzy vibe never feels overwhelming. While a bar stretching half the length of the restaurant gets its fair share of happy-hour crowds, the rear dining rooms offer a more relaxed setting.Pub classics with flair define the menu, like malt-battered cod with creamy tartar sauce and parsley-flecked thick-cut fries—a solid rendition of fish and chips. Keep it light with crunchy watercress and sugar snap pea salad with house-made burrata, or go all out with a plate of chocolate-toffee cream puffs garnished with tender cocoa-dusted marshmallows.
"
600,"This jewel box of a spot is fittingly set adjacent to the Raffaello Hotel. Oozing with elegance, it boasts a crisp style via large windows, tasteful artwork and comfortable leather seats. An azure-blue color theme ensures the mood is serene. If the décor doesn’t evoke the Med, then the Italian-leaning dishes will do the trick. Baked lasagna layered with tender noodles, tomato sauce, béchamel and veal ragù is both delicate and satisfying. A rustic, pan-roasted pork chop cooked a-la-Nonna-style and sided by mashed potatoes is particularly comforting.Some may swap dessert for cheese, but the spumoni, a frozen vanilla sabayon sliced into triangular wedges and topped with fresh strawberries, is a light, slightly-sweet, and elegant finish.
"
601,"This modern French spot—complete with an oyster bar—is set just off the Magnificent Mile. In brief, it's an updated brasserie furnished with sultry lighting and lively chatter. Heavy glass doors lend a certain plush factor, along with a sleek bar, cabernet-red tufted seats, patterned rugs, and burgundy arches.This is Paris by way of the Pendry hotel, and an updated French menu seals the deal. Dishes sound simple and familiar, but in fact brim with inventive twists. Take for example the steak tartare, served with a soft egg, stone-ground mustard, and sunchoke purée finished with dehydrated beef fat. For dessert, chocolate and rye is in fact an ensemble of dark chocolate cookie crumble with a rye brownie and cloud of whipped cream. 
"
602,"Pizza pilgrims continue to make the trek to the original location of this renowned deep-dish chain, where a 45-minute wait is worth every second for freshly baked, steaming pies. The walls, scribbled with years of graffiti, are nearly as iconic as the high-walled pies themselves, whose crusts get their signature crunch from cornmeal and searing-hot metal pans with two inch-high sides.Filled with heaps of mozzarella and toppings, like the “Meaty Legend” lineup of spicy pepperoni, Italian sausage, and both Canadian and regular bacon, it’s hard for some to eat more than two wedges here. The Chicago Fire layers hot and spicy flat sausage, fire-roasted peppers, and red onions for a kicky pie.Nonconformists can opt for thin-crust pies, but why?
"
603,"No matter the time of day, this is a fave among groups craving first-rate Mediterranean cooking with drinks and a setting to match. Everything is tasty, fun and great for sharing, so go with a posse and get a communal table all to yourselves. The bar is just as nice for solo dining, thanks to the chatty staff.The menu covers a range of specialties from this region, including panini to a la plancha; and the kitchen turns out flavor-forward dishes that turn simple into spectacular. Need proof? Try the grilled broccoli dressed with an anchovy vinaigrette, roasted garlic and crunchy breadcrumbs. Smoked pork tongue has a noticeable smokiness with just a tinge of sweetness and is served alongside a crunchy Olivier salad with a macaroni twist.
"
604,"This spiffy and high-flying operation, part of a well-known chain in mainland China, arrives on the heels of such great hits as Meizhou Dongpo in Los Angeles. Inside, the space is done up with cool, lavender-gray hues, sparkling chandeliers, and sleek, intricately carved wood tables. The exposed duct work oozes with all the modern feels.While the menu is impressive in general, diners shouldn't sleep on the fish specials, including whole catfish in a deliciously sour Chengdu-style broth studded with pickled cabbage. Adventurous palates will appreciate grilled frog legs, paired with potato, cauliflower, or even preserved egg with tofu in a cold soy and vinegar sauce. Finish off this flavor explosion simply with fragrant and juicy orange wedges.
"
605,"Chef Jonathon Sawyer's restaurant lives on the seventh floor of the Four Seasons hotel. It's a glorious space with a bar and lounge that blend seamlessly with the airy aesthetic. Hues of silver and black as well as marble floors decorate the room, while a gorgeous light fixture illuminates the bar.The menu is a love letter to global influences along with the bounty of the Midwest. Start with an edible candle made of aged beef suet with a selection of bread—the ""candle"" is lit to melt the fat beside the bread for dipping. If that doesn't speak to a unique vision, think of a peeled tomato tart with Carr Valley cheese or pickle-brined trout with purple shallot sauce. Dessert items may teeter on vague, but ask your server to fill in the blanks. 
"
606,"Modern Chinese Cookbook is the explanation behind the acronym of this modern retreat, tucked inside the sprawling Chinatown Square. You’ll understand the name once you catch sight of their menu—it’s a bible brimming with delicious selections leaning toward spicy Sichuan flavors.Meat or fish cooked over applewood charcoal originated as a street food in Chongqing. But here it’s one of the more unique items, and may be tailed by the equal parts spicy and sour pickle- and fish-soup, which packs a wallop for such a wee bowl. Finally, this kitchen also turns out an excellent version of wok-fried rabbit with cumin, peppercorn and cilantro, but their salt and pepper shrimp can’t be skipped. Full of flavor with a brittle shell, these beauties are hard to resist.
"
607,"Conveniently situated on the ground level of Chinatown Square, MingHin is a stylish standby that draws a diverse crowd to the neighborhood. Spacious dining rooms separated by wooden lattice panels offer seating for a number of occasions, from casual booths and large banquet-style rounds to specially outfitted tables for hot pots.Dim sum is a popular choice even on weekdays, with diners making selections from photographic menus rather than waiting for a passing cart. Among the numerous options, juicy har gow, stuffed with plump seasoned shrimp, always hits the spot. Pan-fried turnip cakes are simultaneously crispy and creamy, studded with bits of pork and mushroom. Fluffy and subtly sweet Malay steamed egg cake is a rare find for dessert.
"
608,"Settled amidst Archer Avenue, this is a rare and stylish dining room. The name in Chinese means ""more music"" and this welcoming, accessible spot is indeed music to the locality's ears. The staff is highly engaged and they also have a full modern bar as well as plenty of on-site parking. And though it’s a stone’s throw from Cermak Road, it feels like a tucked-away treasure.While there’s delicious dim sum to be had, diners would do well to try their hand at the specialty menu that may include a Sichuan-style seafood casserole, flavored with a sauce of chilies, black vinegar, sugar, and ginger. Garlic is a requisite—naturally—as is the shrimp paste, which is also used to garnish a dish of stuffed eggplant with deep-fried tofu and glossy black bean sauce.
"
609,"If there was any question as to whether the Windy City missed Carlos Gaytán, the non-stop crowds here are a sure-fire answer. Inside this gorgeous space—awash in homey earth tones and decorated with ceramics imported directly from Mexico—the energy is palpable and seating ample. But there’s no better perch in the house than at the chef’s counter, where the maestro himself leads his merry team and composes creative dishes that feel at once traditional and inspired. Slivers of pristine hamachi resting in an electric pool of cactus aguachile is a good place to start, as is the comforting tinga de pollo topped with a triangle of fried masa full of hearty black beans.Chef Gaytan is also the man behind the next-door bakery and café, Panango.
"
610,"Buzzworthy and a hit since day one, Chef Paul Kahan’s local darling is one of the most likeable restaurants in town. It's more trendsetting than trendy, and the accommodating staff ensures that no one leaves disappointed.The carte focuses on Italian-leaning seafood dishes, with inspired crudo like hamachi with cara cara orange flesh and garlic chips, or tuna with grilled grapefruit and crispy kale. Take a counter seat at the open kitchen to see just how the Kindai tuna with black trumpet mushrooms and kumquat comes together. The regional menu may also highlight such boldly flavored oceanic treats as chili-cured swordfish with thin, house-made grissini. Desserts, especially the butterscotch cremoso, may be playful in plating, but serious in flavor.  
"
611,"Housed in a sprawling setting adjacent to big brother Gibson’s, Hugo’s always seems packed. The vast dining room sets white linen-topped tables amid dark polished wood and pale walls decorated with a mounted swordfish, fish prints, and model ships. Hugo’s bar draws its own crowd with abundant counter seating. The menu focuses on a selection of fish, steaks, and chops, supplemented by stone crab claws, oysters, crab cakes, chowders, and sautéed frog’s legs. Family-style sides—creamed spinach or roasted Brussels sprouts in Bourbon maple butter—are a worthy addition.With generous portions all around, you'll need a football team to share a slice of the Muddy Bottom Pie, or just a handful of pals to savor other decadent desserts like the apple pie. 
"
612,"This bi-level space, centered around a large wraparound marble bar, flaunts a warm, sleek, and moneyed vibe. The polished black- white- and wood-décor speaks to the finer things in life, with a menu of succulent steaks, shellfish, and sides to boot. There's always a full house; for the best people-watching, score one of the semicircular booths. While the aging process and cuts on offer keep spinning, expect to find Japanese prefectures and solid American producers. Highlights include classic steak frites, petite filets, and that mighty cowboy steak—cooked to pink and seasoned with a winning blend of ground and fried thyme, rosemary, garlic, and kosher salt.The wine list meanders around the globe with nods to Napa, Burgundy, and everything in between.
"
613,"This linchpin in Rick Bayless’ empire is decidedly unique in its homage to regional Mexican cuisine and displays a cult-like devotion to local product. Service at this dining room, psychedelic in its color scheme, can verge on vapid, but find a seat on the bar side for a warmer (and worthier) experience.The ever-changing menu is cohesive, highlighting everything from the ceviches of Baja to the moles of Oaxaca. Begin with the sopa azteca—a nourishing pasilla chile broth poured atop tortilla strips, avocado, grilled chicken and jack cheese. A version of the classic from Morelia, enchiladas a la plaza are first flash-fried, then folded over seasoned cabbage, potatoes and carrots. Pair this with a side of spinach in green chile and you won’t be unhappy.
"
614,"This posh bistro is clearly visible to passersby thanks to its large windows and distinctive signage. Hushed and intimate inside, the dining room is awash in a palette of soothing greys and dressed up with herringbone floors along with black-and-white photography. Servers may be casually dressed, but are attentive and engaging.Brindille’s menu bears a strong Parisian accent influenced by the chef’s love for French cuisine. Roasted chestnuts are whirled into a creamy soup and poured over compressed apple, wild mushrooms and puffed rice. Spot-on Dover sole meunière is plated with a purée of watercress and golden-crisp pommes rissolées. And for dessert, preserved cherries are just one option to fill the baked-to-order almond clafoutis.
"
615,"Though it would also feel at home in Las Vegas, this glitzy oversized steakhouse fits right in with its swanky Chicago riverfront neighbors. The polished, masculine interior makes its priorities clear from the get-go, showcasing a two-story wine tower and a peek into the dry-aging room under bold, barrel-vaulted ceilings and chandeliers.House-flared, thick-cut bacon seasoned with black pepper, Michigan maple syrup, and dark chocolate starts things off on a decadent note, tailed by rosy slices of slow-roasted prime rib rubbed with a crust of herbs. When paired with house-cut fries and horseradish dip, it’s a meal to rival a Porterhouse. But save room for dessert: a single-serving banana cream pie with loads of whipped cream is a whimsical final bow.

616,"Thank chef-to-the-stars Art Smith for raising the stakes of the local dining scene with this relaxed bistro. In 1871, this carriage house home is said to have survived the Great Chicago Fire. Today, the cozy and well-appointed dining room makes the most of its parquet floors, Louis XV-style chairs, welcoming bar, and open kitchen where Southern-leaning fare is prepared in full view. Deviled eggs are a solid staple, elevated ever so slightly with pickled peppers, and the juicy, crunchy fried chicken is a hit for a reason. Signature desserts, like the towering slice of hummingbird cake layered with banana and pineapple or the scrumptious bread pudding, are sized to share. This place becomes even more charming when the weather warms and the patio opens. 
"
617,"Quaint seaside shacks have nothing on this nautical-chic spot. A boomerang-shaped communal table by the raw bar makes a perfect perch for slurping oysters. Lead fishing weights keep napkins in place on brass-edged tables, arranged beneath a chalkboard mural of a jaunty swordfish skeleton. Pescatarians savor the fish dishes meant for sharing—start with snapper ceviche tossed with mashed avocado, tarragon, and served with corn tostadas as well as a salad of frisée and shaved radish. Then move on to a sterling, golden-hued mille feuille, starring layers of puff pastry with piped dots of a cream cheese custard, diced pineapple, and lime sorbet off to one side.Steak lovers should stop by GT Prime, frequented for its luxurious setting and unique cuts of meat.
"
618,"With a sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, this swanky destination is unfailingly packed every evening with a boisterous crowd. The feel inside may be dark and loud, but that only adds to the bonhomie of the chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas.Steakhouse and raw bar standards dominate the menu. Most steaks are wet-aged and though some may prefer more funk, the cuts are expertly broiled. Perfectly rendered steak frites served with a buttery béarnaise sauce is a great way to go. But, the kitchen deserves praise for other, more unexpected options like fresh-baked crab cake with remoulade; or creamy short rib stroganoff bobbing with hand-cut pasta.
"
619,"Add this lustrous pearl to the treasury of Chef José Andrés’ culinary empire. The eye-catching décor includes a glowing octopus sculpture that looms above the central bar--a visual cue for the oceanic theme. Business types make up the bulk of the clientele, but a signature sense of whimsy pervades, keeping things from feeling stuffy.The seafood-centric menu deftly juggles Spanish and Latin-American flavors, seen in starters like mussels in escabeche, or a Peruvian-inspired bigeye tuna ceviche with ponzu sauce, puffed quinoa, and furikake. Oysters on the half shell are delicious as is, but a dose of leche de tigre provides further enhancement. You’ll also find elevated takes on standbys like lobster rolls and fried calamari, all done with a deft touch.
"
620,"Tastefully decorated with lofty windows, red walls hung with evocative Mexican paintings, dark wood floors and a pressed-tin ceiling painted green, this large and lively dining room is much loved. Modern Latino beats (think Elvis Crespo) set the mood for stirring margaritas shaken tableside. Many remember Adobo Grill for its tasty cocktails, but the cooking is just as adept.Guacamole is mashed to-order before your eyes, with just the right bit of jalapeños to suit your preference. Other dishes show a bit of fusion, like the ceviche de atun made with sashimi-grade tuna, cucumbers, serrano chilies and avocado in ginger-soy sauce. Tacos al pastor offer roasted pork and caramelized pineapple topping fresh corn tortillas. Desserts are pleasantly traditional.
"
621,"Strategically set near Union Station, this American institution is beloved by all and sundry. Not only has it stood the test of time—since 1923 to be exact—but thanks to its first-rate comfort food and inviting vibe, it is routinely packed with diners jonesing for classics and signatures.The menu has something for everyone, including soups, chowders, and even a Dutch oven-pot roast or sloppy Joes with coleslaw. Of course, when it comes to grilling, this kitchen is king. Case in point: La Conga Delight, which reveals just the right dot of decadence via slices of buttery brioche stuffed with bacon, tomato, and cheese. Pies and cakes are crafted daily and worth the splurge, especially that dense and creamy chocolate layer cake with frosting to boot.
"
622,"Classic English pies may be the specialty of this house, but don’t let that inspire visions of chintz and tea cozies—the interior here is decidedly modern, with marble-topped tables and hand-crafted pottery.But the crowds come for the pies, and for good reason—they’re fabulous. The crust is flaky and buttery, and the inside, hearty and satisfying. Dig into the steak and ale, with its beef stew filling and side of minty peas, gravy and mashed potatoes, and you’ll be hunting for every last crumb. The comfort food hits also keep on coming, from rarebit mac and cheese with Trooper Ale cheese sauce, to fish and chips on Fridays. Of course, with much of the seasonal greens from local farms, rest assured that even a simple salad will be a revelation.
"
623,"This lovely little jewel sits on a corner of Clinton Street, within the splendid CH Distillery. Prima facie, it looks much like a sports bar, but inside, the aura is that of a beloved pub—dark, sultry, and alive with sports fans. In keeping with its locale, gleaming stills are front and center, while the kitchen is packed with dedicated sushi chefs. Omakase is the way to go, but don't sleep on the à la carte as it features much of the same flavor and quality. A meal here is basically one delicious bite after another—think Massachusetts oysters with yukari ponzu; silky Japanese snapper; and Threeline grunt with rice and seaweed. The fish on offer changes seasonally, but in our experience, shima-aji garnished with mitsuba left a lasting impression.
"
624,"This Mexican restaurant’s slate-colored walls feature a beautiful rotation of work from local artists, making the pieces a great conversation starter even before the delicious fare hits your table. The lovely bar is yet another bit of artistry, featuring shelves tucked around a series of metal branches; and a wonderful, colorful flower motif on the back wall. A relaxed atmosphere, warm service staff and well-made cocktails seal the deal.Many of the recipes have been passed down through the family for generations, and one taste of the silky mole poblano, laced over chicken, will transport you back to the motherland. But it's the creative takes on vegetarian dishes, such as the vegan mole or the flor de Jamaica tacos, that truly stand out. 
"
625,"Housed within a 19th-century print shop, this urbane dining room mixes original details with modern touches. Muted tones in the exposed brick walls and custom tile floors complement newer elements like floor-to-ceiling wine storage and dramatic chandeliers.Chef Andrew Zimmerman’s menu is a delicious amalgam of American cuisine with hints of Southeast Asian, Korean, and Mediterranean tastes. Gnocchi may seem commonplace, but this version is memorable thanks to the rich flavors of lamb sugo and ciabatta breadcrumbs. Chicken is downright exciting, served crisp-skinned with a buttery Albufera sauce, crumbly chestnuts, caramelized fennel, and sausage. Desserts keep the bar high, and may include a toffee-coconut cake with chocolate ganache and burnt caramel.
"
626,"Here at Proxi, Chef Andrew Zimmerman seems intent on presenting his diners with a culinary whirlwind that blows from Thai beef salad to coal-roasted oysters with ssamjang butter and beyond. Otherworldly highlights reveal delicate duck dumplings floating in a pho broth with fried shallots and aromatic herbs. Regardless of the dish’s inspiration, it’s sure to be delicious in this kitchen’s capable hands. Desserts, like avocado mousse, are made with formidable talent.The massive room is effortlessly cool and sleek, with blue-tiled columns set beneath the white-vaulted ceiling. It also features an open kitchen and myriad seating options for everyone—from solo diners to large groups. A front lounge is ideal for lingering and waiting for your party to arrive.
"
627,"From Boka chef, Lee Wolen, this spot brings nostalgia to the fore, by way of its Italian-American cooking. Take your pick from an array of classics, including pizza, pasta, and a host of shareable entrées. Speaking of, rigatoni alla vodka is creamy, sweet, and toothsome; while crispy-skinned chicken al forno arrives perfectly juicy, thanks to an onion agrodolce. A slice of spiced apple crostata with vanilla gelato is perhaps the most winsome way to seal this wistful meal.The setting is luxurious without question. There are crystal pendants, hand-painted tile floors, and an amber-tinted sculpture floating overhead. An open kitchen, rustic stone bar, and that light murmur from the good-looking patrons make it an ideal destination for every type of occasion.
"
628,"Fans have been clamoring for the dinner plates at this West Randolph mainstay for more than a decade—and now that lunch is on the menu, it’s official: Avec is a non-stop hangout. It’s a fun vibe, as diners are tightly packed at a long counter with communal seats in the chic wood plank-encased room; servers do a good job attending to the crowd.Mediterranean flavors factor prominently in the kitchen’s stimulating creations, like a kale and carrot salad dressed with delightfully herbaceous and spicy green harissa as well as sunflower seeds for crunch. A thick slice of excellent whole grain bread spread with walnut-beet muhamarra is the foundation of an open-faced roasted salmon sandwich. Other delights—there are many—come and go with the seasons.
"
629,"TenGoku is a take on izakaya food by the talented Chef Sangtae Park. In Japan it's most rare to land upon a restaurant that serves it all, but this team certainly bucks that trend. Of course, it helps that the informal space was conceived solely with pub grub in mind.Set upon a well-lit corner, imagine such evocative details as paper chandeliers and white noren hangings. If that doesn't instantly transport you back East, the delicious and carefully prepared food will fill the bill. There is something for everyone on this ample and versatile carte. From tako yaki (octopus fritters with unagi-teriyaki sauce) and assorted maki, to a bowl of heartwarming udon and maze soba with ground pork, fish flakes, and egg, this kitchen delivers to your heart's content.
"
630,"Julia Momosé is the creative force behind this hip corner haven. The name depicts a woodworking technique, and its serene surrounds feature a deluge of natural light. Informed and attentive servers glide through the room—perhaps in tune with moody jazz tunes—delivering a lineup of creative plates. Japanese potato salad with pickled rainbow carrots and smoked ham is a strong opener; while tonkatsu sando with Berkshire pork and buttered shokupan is hearty and substantial. Maitakédon (marinated hen of the woods mushrooms with caramelized onion and onsen tamago) is accompanied by white rice for a fragrant feast.Teetotalers will treasure the litany of memorable spiritfree sips, like the Remedy with kinmokusei, fennel seed, and artisanal tonic.
"
631,"This small and clean dining enclave brought to you by Chef/owner Sangtae Park is lined with planks of blonde wood and offers two nightly seatings at its eight-seat bar.Dishes tend to headline top ingredients that are smartly paired and well executed. Savor the chef's unfaltering focus on Japanese cuisine by way of deep-fried nasu hirame; Edo-style sushi featuring madai, akami, and chutoro; as well as slices of Wagyu beef atop sushi rice. Other delicacies like torigai (heart clam), correctly aged sayori, or grilled misoyaki flaunt a thorough study in product sourcing, fresh flavors, and delectable textures. Sweet and custardy tamago, followed by matcha panna cotta—deeply colorful, full-bodied and tart with creamy buttermilk—bring the meal to a close.
"
632,"This charming Arts and Crafts building may have started life as a warming shelter for park ice skaters, but today it is a special and intimate dining room. The space always sparkles, thanks largely to rustic exposed brick and windows overlooking the park and eponymous pond.Chef Cesar Murillo's expertise lies in churning out a menu of hyper-seasonal food. Subtle global inflections are another enticing facet of his tasting menu, which might unveil the likes of tagliatelle tinted gold with saffron and tossed with mussels escabeche. Sweet corn gazpacho poured over poached octopus and heirloom cherry tomatoes is worthy of applause; and a flourless chocolate-hazelnut cake with ganache and goat milk sorbet follows close on the heels of the soigné, savory meal.
"
633,"Together with his co-owner and wife, Katrina Bravo, Chef Jenner Tomaska lays bare lofty ambitions at this airy atelier. The minimalist, well-lit space evokes an art gallery, complete with a high-concept tasting that's aimed at blurring the boundaries between art and dining.The show begins with intriguing bites served at standing tables just inside. The multi-course meal that follows features a variety of dishes, each offered on custom pieces made by local artists. Flavorful compositions showcase unexpected combinations like a seared rouget fillet set atop a bean purée and shaved matsutake mushrooms. Accompanied by a bowl of beans in an Ibérico ham consommé studded with tender ""pearls"" of apple, the dish's sweetness works wonders against its savory essence.
"
634,"Thanks to a dramatic renovation, Oriole has resurfaced in fine fettle—even more graceful and luxurious than before. While its industrial bones remain, the space now has a bespoke elegance evidenced by imposing ceilings and an impressive bar. The beautifully appointed kitchen is in full view.Chef Noah Sandoval and team are deeply committed to and passionate about their unbridled creations. Your meal may start with an aperitif and bites, like raw hiramasa in apple broth. New Zealand langoustine is elevated to luscious heights thanks to tapioca, melon, and a warm coconut broth; while sablefish nestled into koshihikari rice is enhanced tableside with amazake. Lemon soufflé with Délice de Bourgogne reflects an inspired take on the faithful cheese course.
"
635,"A fresh perspective on classic Japanese cuisine awaits at KŌMO. Located on the restaurant-studded W. Randolph St., its muted exterior gives way to a beautiful, tranquil interior. The first-floor dining room and bar is in full view once the screen doors are opened. Soaring ceilings, blossom-filled branches, and colorful banquettes enhance the lush factor; and the lighting is as exemplary as the music.This unique carte, from Chef Macku Chan, unites traditional Japanese flavors with bold accents. Behold the savory chawanmushi with sweet pear ""sauce"" and kanpachi sashimi kicked up a notch with jalapeño. A flight of deliciously embellished bluefin (akami, chutoro, and toro) may then be sealed by such sweet eats as braised Asian pear with fried banana.
"
636,"Veteran chef B.K. Park has spun out this inspiring shrine to omakase. With nothing but a lone plaque marking its entrance, this Japanese delight can be tough to spot. But once inside, the surrounding din of traffic fades and you’ll be transfixed by the team's dedication to sushi.Mako is a hot ticket, with just 22 seats from which to savor the smartly considered omakase. Throughout the evening, the chef and itamae showcase their style through unique adornments, like sudachi juice and sesame-pepper soy. Equally enticing are cooked items, like braised abalone or black cod with burnt scallion ponzu. Not to be outdone, chawanmushi stocked with mushroom and crab is the essence of elegance. Dessert is not an afterthought, as in sweet potato with whiskey caramel.
"
637,"This bright and beautiful setting, located at the edge of the crowded dining strip of West Randolph, is spread over two floors and outfitted with deep blue velvet seats. Libations poured here have their own flavor matrix—study them if you must but rest assured that all are great.Similarly, the menu is dotted with Indian classics enhanced by such cutting-edge flavors as seen in the deep-fried cauliflower koliwada, accompanied by tempered yogurt and a rice mousse with peanut thecha. Follow this up with hearty beef short rib curry stocked with carrots and marrow kofta. Classic palates will relish the wonderfully creamy dal coupled with a plain naan for scooping, while a baked semolina cake with milk ice cream and pistachios will have sweet teeth swooning.
"
638,"You don’t want to miss a morsel at this spiffy Mexican charmer. Tucked into a hip space that’s both stylish and comfortable, the dining room is flooded with light thanks to floor-to-ceiling windows, and the bar buzzes with energy as bartenders whip up colorful handcrafted cocktails.La Josie is modern enough where you might expect to find fusion, but this family-run kitchen leans traditional—imagine comforting dishes crafted with pristine ingredients and careful technique. Chef/owner Jose Luis Barajas (AKA Pepe) shows a particularly deft hand in his picture-perfect tacos stuffed with delicious pairings like shredded achiote pork, pickled red onions, and fiery salsa habanero; or tender Amish chicken with crumbled queso fresco and grilled corn kernel salad.
"
639,"On cold nights, gathering around one of the fireplaces at this River West favorite hits all the right notes. The Dawson has everything you can ask for in a gastropub—a convivial vibe, clever bites and wraparound bar pouring stirring libations. Speaking of which, the Surfer Rosa with tequila, blood orange, and chilies, attracts spirited guests like moths to a flame. A communal table and open kitchen with counter offer multiple opportunities for meeting, greeting, and eating.When hunger strikes, get nibbling on chicken fried lobster with spicy ranch or roasted cauliflower with a boldly spiced masala. Lest you forget, seared duck breast and sausage with Oaxacan mole is great for sharing; while a Bourbon caramel blondie sundae is the stuff of dessert dreams.
"
640,"The revolving door never stops turning as Girl &amp; The Goat’s party keeps going. Even on a Monday night, guests linger for hours, shouting over the din at this sceney but always friendly stunner. Appropriately rustic wooden pillars and beams connect a warren of seating areas, from elevated platforms to banquettes to dim private corner nooks.A pick-your-own-protein adventure, the menu is organized by ingredients with a dedicated section for goat. Start with freshly baked ham bread accompanied by smoked Swiss cheese-butter seasoned with coarse mustard and olive tapenade. End with an almost pudding-like “all leches” cake enriched with strawberry-rhubarb sorbet. The kitchen may even send out mini portions of menu items for solo diners—a truly thoughtful touch.
"
641,"This passion project of Chef Thai Dang and wife, Danielle, offers refined Vietnamese cuisine in a plum setting. The menu, divided into five sections, is filled with wonderful, lesser-known (and possibly unexpected) dishes you won’t want to miss. The restaurant offers many seating options: an open kitchen fringed with comfy seats; a bar area for cocktails and perhaps an order of those famous chicken wings; as well as two dining rooms, one with communal seating. Don’t leave without sampling the goi vit (duck salad), followed by ché, a Vietnamese rice pudding with coconut, sesame, and toasted peanuts.For street food, specialty coffee and quenching cocktails, visit their next-door coffee shop, Cà Phê Đá.
"
642,"Creatively adorned, Americanized nigiri is the featured attraction at this hip sushi-ya that’s all wood planks, stainless steel, chunky tables, and hefty benches.Why just have one piece when you can have two? Here, each order is served in pairs. Among the selection, enjoy the likes of hamachi sporting a spicy mix of shredded Napa cabbage, daikon, and red chili; or salmon dressed with a sweet ginger-soy sauce and fried ginger chips. South Pacific sea bream is deliciously embellished with a drizzle of smoky tomato and black sea salt. Those who wish to branch out opt for takoyaki (crispy fried octopus croquettes) or grilled hamachi collar. To finish, try the brownie-crusted green tea-cheesecake or Fuji Fu apple cake with peanuts and caramel sauce.
"
643,"Part of Francesca's Restaurant Group, this Italian kitchen is the passion project of owner Joe Fiely and Chef Scott Harris.The setting albeit snug exudes an air of elegance by way of a marble bar, beautifully appointed tables, and plush leather banquettes. Walls of ash-gray exposed brick are adorned with gilded mirrors and dramatic light fixtures. But, it's really the food that steals the show here—with surprises at every turn. Contrasting ingredients and textures can be found in such comforting plates as cacio e pepe finished with Sichuan peppercorns and lemon rind. Lamb meatballs served with a feta-dotted raita, followed by treats like a clean mango sorbet or rich chocolate Royal, may be perfectly paired with one amongst their many dessert wines.
"
644,"Boka Restaurant Group’s stunning West Loop canteen embraces a fantastical view of Japanese dining. An impressive selection of imported whiskies is listed on a retro-style departure board; while a private dining room upstairs is styled to resemble a mid-century corporate boardroom. Consistently packed, this impeccably designed space boasts numerous kitchens churning out a range of dishes, all conceived by the talented Executive Chef Gene Kato.Jidori kimo, those prized chicken oysters—here grilled to perfection—has long been a signature, while the beef tsukune sliders in a bao from the robata-yaki are equally impressive. Don't miss the delicious nigiri or maki, including una-kyu or the ebi uni maguro, of which there are only ten per evening, so plan ahead.
"
645,"Come to this stylish retreat in the Hoxton hotel for an all-day carte of light bites and hearty mains, which roam the cuisines of the Mediterranean countries. If the flavors of Turkey, Algeria, Spain, and Italy com to mind, you're starting to get the picture. Naturally, what results is a progressive and wholesome feast, at the hands of Chef Chris Pandel. His dishes are bright, elegant and precisely seasoned, as in avocado toast elevated with Green Goddess dressing and heaps of herbs; tailed by slow-braised short ribs with ""cacio e pepe"" polenta and pickled pearl onions. If grilled delicata squash with pomegranate yogurt is on offer, jump on it and you may never want for dessert again.In the summer, ""aperitivo hour"" has the outdoor tables booked and abuzz.
"
646,"Everything about this local restaurant screams happy place—and scream you might have to. Rest assured though as the noisy din is all just part of the fun. Inside, diners will discover a dining concept, based on century-old public houses and marked by equal parts lively conversations and pours of beer.Each item on the menu lists its place of origin next to it: for instance, cobia caught in Destin, FL; or lettuce grown in Buckley, MI. Global flavors make a guest appearance too, as evidenced by the jamón Serrano from Salamanca, Spain. Portraits of pigs hang in the room, and sure enough, braised pork belly first flash-fried and then laid over a sunchoke purée studded with blanched fava beans makes for a spectacular finish.
"
647,"“First we eat, then we do everything else,” said M.F.K. Fisher, the food writer who serves as both the inspiration and namesake for this local darling. Thanks to large windows, whitewashed brick walls and silver-and-white tilework, the subterranean space manages to evoke a breezy oasis. Organized from small to large plates, the thoughtfully composed, Iberian-inspired menu follows suit.Daily specials are certainly worth ordering, including the clove-infused tender, shredded oxtail. Other simple, flavorful dishes, like warm boquerónes stuffed with marinated anchovies and Fresno chilies, or croquettes with Montamoré cheese and Sherry aïoli are equally tempting. A crumbly slice of Basque cake and an expertly pulled cortado end the meal on a high note.
"
648,"This is a sultry spot, replete with a warm and inviting vibe. Local artist Avril Zayas is the designer of the space, which in turn boasts a beach-y feel. Imagine golden hues (reminiscent of a sunset), wicker-basket lampshades, and tequila bottles.The place is named for chicatanas (a species of ants that swarm Oaxaca each spring), and its food is as authentic as the location is prime. From antojitos and tacos to otros, every dish by Chef Guillermo Reyes is delicious. If the roasted beet salad is on offer, go for it. Then indulge in such tacos as the beef suadero or seasonal soft-shell crab. There's no going wrong with any one of the ""otros,"" including pescado à la plancha. Helado de horchata is an exquisite way to seal the meal.
"
649,"Conceived by Chef Joe Flamm, this neighborhood delight in the West Fulton Market is worth every bit of hype—from its singular menu to the airy design. Imagine a setting that evokes Croatia's konobas (akin to a rustic trattoria) featuring whitewashed walls, rustic clay, and hanging plants with seating that can easily accommodate some-100 diners.Well-versed servers are on hand to guide patrons through the menu, which draws inspiration from the Adriatic. High points include tortellini djuvec (eggplant and preserved zucchini in a red pepper cream) as well as burek with ground beef and mozzarella. The charcoal hearth is solely responsible for such sumptuous mains as lamb with blitva and potatoes. Save room for sweet treats like rosewater fritule.
"
650,"Gaijin is Paul Virant's love letter to okonomiyaki. Okonomi in Japanese means ""what you like” and accordingly guests here are encouraged to choose their own course. Thanks to his time in Japan, the chef displays ace skills and experience. Osaka and Hiroshima are the main styles on his menu, which also flaunts a custom brew from Moody Tongue. While Tuesdays bring a tonkatsu feast, steamed rice with furikake, miso soup, and tsukemono are eternal hits. Desserts, like shirokuma with pineapple-buttermilk sherbet and coconut syrup, are worth the splurge.The room resembles a veritable izakaya, with an okonomiyaki griddle dominating the space—and conversation. Brass accents, exposed brick, and concrete floors add a dash of rusticity to this otherwise premium den.
"
651,"This subterranean dining room is unique in its location, manner and mission. Tucked under the riotous Roister, it makes a sultry and chic reprieve, as guests hand over all decision-making to the team. Celebrating the once popular mid-western ""supper club"" vibe, St. Clair—also Grant Achatz's birthplace—is similarly furnished with low ceilings, tobacco leather banquettes, and comfy green chairs.Solo diners head to the bar for a stiff cocktail and slab of prime rib, while larger parties start their meal with smaller bites, like crab cakes and oysters Rockefeller. Steak—well, prime rib—certainly plays first fiddle, but sides like ""Yorkshire pudding"" popovers are comfort to the core. Chocolate torte with black cherries completes the classic American feast.
"
652,"Whether you come to experience the cuisine of ancient Rome or Hollywood, a meal here is pure dinner theater. These culinary themes are unique and exceptionally thoughtful, leaving happy crowds waiting to see what's ""next.""While the earlier Italia menu showcased complex ingredients, flawless flavors, and extraordinary textures (think cacio e pepe, guanciale-wrapped branzino, and veal cheek agrodolce atop a savory bread pudding), the Tenth Anniversary menu celebrated the best moments in the restaurant's last decade. Highlights included fish and chips, complete with balsamic dressing and a malt vinegar ""sea foam."" The Basque cheesecake was delightfully decadent.Servers are fully vested and display an encyclopedic knowledge of each prevailing topic.
"
653,"In contrast to the boundary-pushing Alinea and the elaborate whims of Next, Chef Grant Achatz's Roister is downright rustic and approachable. Boldly incorporated into its dark dining room, the kitchen serves as the focal point of this unapologetically loud and laid-back space—where the best seats are at the counter, facing the blazing hearth.The cooking is hearty and refined, incorporating that wood fire at every turn possible. Start with the likes of hearth-roasted rainbow carrots enriched by smoked labneh and pistachio croutons, before digging into a bowl of rigatoni with Wagyu Bolognese. Smoke even finds its way into dessert, like a boulder of ember ice cream served on a bed of crushed hazelnuts, cherry jam, and milk chocolate mousse.
"
654,"Chez Joël is a tasteful setting beloved by expats recalling their travel stories. Here, walls gleam thanks to a grand chandelier, framed French posters, and ice-blue accents; windows are dressed with velvet; and the courtyard outdoors beckons on warm days. A cozy bar in the back is ideal for sipping, but then get down to business by partaking in this kitchen’s cuisine—classic French mingled with global effects.Begin with such signatures as cuisses de grenouilles à la Provençale—frogs' legs cooked with garlic, spinach and just the right bit of butter. Then linger over a perfect bowl of Gruyère-capped French onion soup. A riff on the rustic coq au vin renders the bird crisp on the outside, juicy inside. Profiteroles or crème brûlée make a divine finale.
"
655,"With the inception of this large steakhouse at 1K Fulton, New York City-based design firm AvroKO adds to their local portfolio in collaboration with the Boka Restaurant Group. A renovated meat and produce warehouse built in the 1920s, this space unwinds from a raw bar aptly named Cold Storage into a plush hangout. Here, striking wood-trimmed arches and concrete columns modulate the scale of the rooms.The kitchen’s contemporary take on steak serves up USDA Prime beef seared at high heat and presented with a trio of sauces. It’s the kind of place where gluttony is rewarded—even the wine list features Coravin selections in three- or six-ounce pours. Extras (like king crab Oscar) or desserts (like Boston cream pie) are worth the calories.
"
656,"Chef Sarah Grueneberg is a local celebrity, so expect her offspring to be packed to the last dining counter stool by 5:30 P.M. Then again this is prime seating, because behind that wood-grain bar lies the pasta station where sheets are rolled, cut, and hung to dry. Her signature Italian cooking—or cucina tipica as the menu lists it—is what draws crowds.That said, this menu is about more than just pasta, beginning with an extraordinary yet humble vessel displaying bundles of cabbage leaves stuffed with herbed breadcrumbs, mushrooms, and  porcini Bolognese. Subbing whey for water in the cacio whey pepe delivers a slight tang and added creaminess, and the al dente pasta, tossed in Pecorino Romano and finished with a four peppercorn blend, is spot on. 
"
657,"On the one hand, Dusek’s is a gastropub serving food that is as down-to earth as one of their roasted pretzels tucked with cheese and hot beer mustard. On the other hand, it's just the place to meet for a bite before heading to nearby Thalia Music Hall. The space seems dark and moody, but everyone is having a rollicking good time. Its front room is like a tavern, while the back is a dining room warmed by wood-burning ovens. Menu favorites include a boudin blanc sandwich with beef-fat fries; and bacon-covered country pâté with toasted crostini. Close out with an American mash-up of the classic Paris-Brest, featuring chocolate and peanut butter.The craft beer selection is terrific with mostly local varietals, so ask your server for pairing suggestions.
"
658,"Thanks to their ambitious Asian-accented cooking, S.K.Y.'s moniker could easily double as its descriptor. Make your way inside this versatile restaurant to discover a setting that's textbook industrial-chic—a large dining room decked out with metal beams, exposed brick, and distressed walls. The kitchen is open and always humming.The slightly motley menu features everything from cornbread madeleines to foie gras-bibimbap, so this is just the sort of place to bring a friend or group in order to sample more of the eclectic food. Speaking of, embark on a tour of their greatest hits, which may include seared Scottish salmon with cauliflower caponata and white shrimp ceviche. The maitake mushroom salad scattered with goat cheese is revered for good reason.
"
659,"Head to the Bridgeport warehouses, where this stylish, modern tavern—helmed by Executive Chef Kevin Hickey—feels like a diamond in the rough. Then make your way past the buzzy bar (pouring heady cocktails) to a semi-open kitchen, which is in full view of the decorous dining room, featuring wood tables and mid-century modern seats.The cuisine may be coined as ""working-class fine dining,"" but there is nothing lowbrow about this menu, which unveils a focused but diverse selection of small plates and mains. Japanese barbecue sauce and sesame seeds are the crowning touch to duck wings, while foie gras mousse with celery fronds and brioche is a study in fine flavors and textures. Of course, regulars know to save room for the Chicago-style duck fat dog.
"
660,"Chef Grant Achatz continues to burst with novel ideas at this ingenious, substantive, and festive temple. Dining here is part theater and pure pleasure; and meals are an olfactory experience by dint of scented vapors, tricks, and tableside fun.Executive Chef Douglas Alley is firmly in play, turning out whimsical items that are at times experimental. For starters, a custom resin dish bearing cured Arctic char, crowned by crisped skin glazed with maple syrup. The dish is then flipped to reveal roe suspended in smoke gel. The flavors of Thailand follow in salt-baked kohlrabi shaved tableside. The meal meets its dramatic end with a ""Paint"" dessert—think of a Pollock-esque creation with blueberries and a liquid N2-frozen block of chocolate mousse smashed to bits.

Whether waking up with brunch, snacking at aperitivo hour, or filling up at the bar with the $25 trio, there’s an excuse to stop in for any occasion or budget. While the service may not always be the most welcoming, seasonal dishes are well executed and represented throughout the menu. Here, a wood-burning oven turns out a range of pizzas as well as mains, such as grilled branzino topped with lightly dressed salad greens and shaved radish. Half-portion pastas are available for the less ravenous, like spaghetti cacio e pepe with Tellicherry peppercorns and parmesan.End with a bit of sweet—as in the Tuscan torta della nonna with baby pine nuts coating a vanilla-custard pie.
"
663,"Chicago and pizza go together like peanut butter and jelly, but does the Windy City need yet another shop dedicated to the crusty stuff? If it is this one, you bet your brick-lined gas oven it does, as this excellent rendition gives any of its kind a run for their money.A crispy crust with cornicione that crackles with flavor—this is a first-class pizza. You can’t go wrong here, whether you veer simple with a Margherita (San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella); have a little fun with the Jalapeno Business (mozzarella, broccoli rabe, pickled jalapeños and pimento cheese); or go nutty with nutless pesto, vodka sauce and fresh mozz. Pizzas may be the star at this gleaming spot, but the hearty frittata proves that their other staples deserve equal billing.
"
664,"The restaurant-studded W. Randolph corridor recently welcomed the gleaming Gioia. Set amid a host of new developments, it is in full swing, thanks to its authentically Italian accents and contemporary mien—elegant Venetian stucco walls and a blast of blue via a piece of art. The black marble bar encourages nursing—a negroni, maybe?The menu is a veritable resume of Chef Federico Comacchio's years of experience in Italian kitchens. A simple salad (croccante) arrives perfectly dressed with vincotto and stracciatella; while veal tortellini in a brown butter-and-sage sauce explodes with flavor. Hearty types won't be able to resist the maialetto, which includes pork belly and baby back ribs, with roasted potatoes. It's very straightforward and very enjoyable.
"
665,"It's a simple, sleek spot with weathered wood floors, exposed brick, and pendant lights. Leather banquettes along the periphery and tables in the center are some of the other features of this Central Asian culinary operation. The menu is chock-full of Kurdish classics, with similarities from the cuisines of Turkey, Middle East, and even India. Start off with addictive spreads like tirşik and sac tawa, before digging into hearty meats, available at lunch and dinner. Breakfast is no laughing matter though, with black sesame-studded bread, house preserves, kasheri cheese, and cucumbers dressed in olive oil. Eggs scrambled with roasted peppers, onion, and tomatoes are matched with golden cups of coffee as well as bottomless Kurdish tea for a warming treat.
"
666,"Its exterior is unassuming, but one step inside the rustic-chic hot spot and you'll be smitten by its lively vibe, warm hospitality, and seductive aromas. Acclaimed chef, Zach Engel, brings his experience to bear on this personal brand of modern Middle Eastern cuisine. His prix-fixe allows diners to make their own selections from a range of options, but sharing is key to cover the most ground. Kick things off with salatim (spreads and pickles) accompanied by flame-kissed pita. Even familiar dishes offer surprising depth, like creamy hummus or crackling-crisp falafel with mango labneh.Dessert manages to be just as tantalizing as the savory fare. Sample an updated spin on baklava with white chocolate and raspberry for a wonderfully elegant finale.
"
667,"This is a small but cute spot, with the smell of smoke wafting up through the air and on to the sidewalk. The décor features some novel touches, like corrugated metal, wood blocks that appear to be dripping in tar, and a black wall strikingly marked by a red, orange, and yellow stripe.A small service bar has the menu posted overhead; while tables may be laden with such classic barbecue delights as spice-rubbed pork ribs, deeply tender brisket, and smoked pastrami, all of which highlight delicious charred flavor and meltingly tender meat. No doubt barbecue is the main feature, but one can virtually make a meal out of the sides alone. Think: delightfully spongy and creamy corn pudding; slowly simmered collard greens; as well as deeply addictive mac and cheese.
"
668,"What's the best Italian-American restaurant in town? There is no right answer. Then consider Chef/owners Ian Rusnak and Eric Safin's newcomer and you might just change your mind. With Sinatra crooning overhead, sleek wood overtones, and handsome leather, it's hard not to be besotted by this intimate little gem—and everyone is.It's BYOB, so dust off your best Barolo and waltz on in. A hearty bread basket is the kickoff of dreams, while that cherished classic, clams casino, flaunts a divine blend of taste and texture. Rigatoni a la vodka requires little introduction but a garnish of breadcrumbs makes a welcome surprise. Then, chicken parmesan arrives surmounted with marinara and mozz. If the words nostalgic and classic come to mind, you get the picture.
"
669,"Make your way past a charming brown stone-like exterior and set of heavy wooden doors to arrive at this Mexican gem composed with vaulted wood ceilings and wrought -iron chandeliers. The brick walls of this bi-level space are decked out with ranchero-inspired paraphernalia, so if images of cowboy hats and lariats come to mind, you're at the right spot. The center kitchen's open flames exude with that appetizing aroma of meat charring. Speaking of, go for the norteño -style steak or arrachera available by the kilo or half. Light flour tortillas are made fresh daily; while tortilla chips with red and green salsa are nothing to sneeze at. Sweet tooths will be rewarded by the home-spun tres leches with a properly sweetened sponge cake and coconut flakes.

A compilation of charred leeks and oats is topped with a clothbound cheddar ""bèchamel.""
"
672,"Smyth is so very chic, styled with a small lounge area resembling a living room, while a large portion of the floor plan is devoted to the impressive open kitchen. This talented brigade, led by Chefs John Shields and Karen Urie Shields, has evolved since opening. Theirs is cooking that is desirable, impactful, and doesn't need an onslaught of luxury ingredients to impress. Instead, sheer creativity is applied to seasonal produce. Wild Maine mussels are in a savory licorice cream; chilled avocado delights with Bangkok guava paste and hoja santa. Then uni arrives glazed in egg yolk, while venison is spruced up with truffle liver ragout and sauce civet. For dessert, saffron ice cream drizzled with beeswax-thickened honey sits atop roasted quince.
"
673,"The surrounds are industrial and rather bleak, but get up close only to discover this veritable mirage of a spot. Settled on a bright corner, it is a pulsating retreat that virtually lures you in with hospitality. If that's not irresistible, the interior features a series of intriguing murals by street artist, Senkoe; aqua-blue chairs, cement floors, and a DJ booth complete the festive look.Diners are attended to by a small army of smiling servers. Pan-Mexican dishes are on the menu, with such popular plates as a whole-grilled pineapple stuffed with tender octopus, chipotle-cream sauce, and Chihuahua cheese; or a spicy and smoky seafood paella.

"
674,"Sure, you could come for a salad, but the focus here is on pizza—and yours should be, too. The dining room is cozy, showcasing an open kitchen where pie production is on full display for all to see. And in a playful bit of recycling, empty tomato sauce cans placed on each table become stands for sizzling pizzas churned straight from the 800-degree coal-fired oven.This hot spot has its ratio down to a fine art and knows not to burden its thin and crispy crust that’s blackened and blistered in all the right places. The mortadella is a delight, with chopped garlic and gossamer slices of peppercorn-flecked sausage. But if you wish to go your own way, build the perfect pie with toppings that run the gamut from decadent Gorgonzola to tangy goat cheese.
"
675,"This good-looking stage is a refreshing and welcome respite from the heavy-hitting Devon Avenue spots. Named for the mythical weapon of the Hindu God of Thunder, the dining room is hugely appealing, thanks to an array of windows draped with billowing fabric, intricately carved artwork, and a spectrum of purple hues.Born in Nepal, Executive Chef Min B. Thapa is no stranger to Chicago's culinary scene. His cooking is replete with wonderful, rich flavors and unique methods, as might be sampled in the crispy pakoras, samosas, and flaky parathas, all of which arrive with a medley of zesty chutneys. Mains, like perfectly tart and boldly spiced lamb vindaalu or marinated tandoori goat chops, reach sumptuous new heights when accompanied by soft jasmine rice.
"
676,"Sequestered inside a rather plain and dimly lit space, a bar up front gives way to this more contemporary and bright dining room. The latter is a hit among locals and tourists looking to get all dressed-up for a night out on the town.The menu has a handful of small plates, including delicacies like juicy chicken meatball skewers with a pepper-soy glaze, but the main attraction is their wide variety of sushi. Traditional options appear alongside more creative signature takes, and Chef B.K. Park's deft touch with seafood can be seen in both. Specialties include the Juno Queen, a nigiri featuring salmon and spicy scallop with potato crunch. Other items, like a spicy octopus hand roll or soy-marinated sea eel dabbed with sesame seeds, also make a fine feast.
"
677,"Housed along a thriving row of Mexican restaurants, this beau stands tall due to its singular focus on pork. Enter only to find yourself enveloped in intoxicating aromas wafting from flash-fried chicharrónes and a pig roasting. A simple, laminated menu caters to those who wish to linger—perhaps over the popular carnitas special, featuring a plate of deliciously tender pork, crispy dorado taco, frijoles, and a refreshing agua fresca to seal the savory meal. An order of creamy guac is a nice contrast to the light nopales salad. Word to the wise: knowing Spanish is a handy asset when dealing with the warm, efficient staff.This original location is currently take-out only, but a second location in Gage Park offers dine-in.
"
678,"Chef and co-owner Jourdan Higgs is pushing boundaries at his new restaurant—a small and intimate gem, where Creole and Italian cuisines converge. This dining room makes its debut with a burst of color, weathered wood, as well as an array of neatly arranged tables. And let's not forget the playlist, which is perfectly aligned with the saucy and spicy fare. On the menu, the chef pays homage to his Sicilian grandfather and the results are just full of surprises. Our experience involved ""crabby fries;"" shatteringly crisp calamari tucked with jalapeños and banana peppers; and trenette pasta tossed with cognac-splashed shrimp scampi.

"
679,"Located just a stone’s throw from the National Museum of Mexican Art, this south-of-the-border charmer boasts a colorful dining room peppered with artwork, thumping cumbia music, and a chill vibe that makes you want to linger forever. The deliciously authentic food just brings it all home. Chef Alfonso Sotelo worked for Rick Bayless and his accomplished resume comes to life in this kitchen.Warm tortillas crafted from heirloom Oaxacan masa are folded around the likes of goat adobo barbacoa, savory carnitas, and mole enchiladas. But save room for pozole pipian verde, a white bowl of the classic green-tinted elixir with hominy and shredded pork. Garnished with cabbage, jalapeño, and lime, the soup arrives with tortilla chips for a successful partnership.

681,"Across from Wrigley Field and brought to the Windy City by the Boka Group, this casual spot is well-tread by oyster-slurpers and beer drinkers. The mien is airy and modern, with large windows and colorful accents; downstairs, wood floors give way to black-and-white tiles around the horseshoe bar. Service walks the line between casual and skillful.A selection of raw oysters puts patrons in the mood for seriously good food. From there, proceed to an offering of these bivalves—baked, sizzling, and served with crusty bread for a heady spread. Then a giant, house-made pretzel is matched with warm queso for decadence galore. Po'boys are beloved by lighter appetites, while the fried chicken or hanger steak frites with horseradish cream promises to feed an army.
"
682,"Just a baseball’s throw away from Wrigley Field, this restaurant is named for legendary Cubs pitcher, Mordecai Brown. Set inside the trendy Hotel Zachary, it appeals to sophisticated diners with its stylish interior, outdoor patio and impressive Bourbon collection.Crowd-pleasers like fried cheese curds and burgers make an appearance on the menu, but this isn’t your usual ballpark bites-kind of joint. In fact, Jonah crab arancini over squid ink aïoli elevate finger food, while roasted trout with yuzu emulsion and crisp, herb-seasoned porchetta have highbrow leanings. Stuffed with caramel popcorn, Bavarian cream, and topped with crushed peanuts as well as puffed sorghum, the crackerjack donut is a delicious riff on the popular stadium snack.
"
683,"Located over on the ""Elston Industrial Corridor"" is this spot with two distinct experiences. The first floor izakaya caters to those in the mood for some sips (think terrific cocktails) and snacks (Wagyu sliders, anyone?). However, it's Omakase by Hinoki Sushiko, the counter located on the second floor, that shines. Upstairs, the dining space is minimally adorned with a blonde wood bar, brick wall, and decorative wallpaper. The spotlight however is entirely on the chef, as he prepares and perfects each item on offer—from Ora King salmon, poached shrimp, and Tasmanian ocean trout, to madai, hamachi, and kanpachi. The technique behind sweet and flaky black cod is nothing short of masterful.
"
684,"Striking, dedicated and delicious are an apt way to describe this passion project from Chef Marcos Campos and Owner Daniel Alejandro Alonso—both of whom are champions of La Brújula, the noted women-owned conserva company. A stone-carved chandelier, metallic accents and hand-painted ceramics are merely some of the flourishes of this dreamy room. Still not besotted? Think of the menu, dominated by ingredients cooked on an open flame. Find a perch at the horseshoe bar and let the team tease your taste buds with uni toast accompanied by cauliflower crema; or Galician octopus with judión bean purée. Using seaweed in place of spaghetti, pasta do mar is the epitome of invention. Close out with pan con chocolate, starring pork-fat brioche and brown butter foam.

"
685,"Marked by an expansive space, this is one of the more unique concepts to arrive on Chicago's culinary scene. Beatnik is nothing less than a sensory haven; amid all the bodies under glittering chandeliers, find double-height ceilings, repurposed street lights, an atrium, and colorful tiles—all of which evoke an inviting Mediterranean vibe.Allow your gaze to wander away from the mesmerizing décor to focus on its diverse cuisine, infused with North African elements. Start with halloumi and fattoush, before savoring Cornish game hen tagine with cauliflower and turmeric purée. Sweetbread kebabs with vadouvan and zhoug speak to the team's versatility. Not everything is perfect, but there is talent here and joy to be had from Chef Marcos Campos' menu.
"
686,"This jewel box is the epitome of subtlety, serenity, and sophistication. Year after delicious year, the kitchen team flaunts their supreme talent. Each dish is a personal expression of their passion and vision. Playful delicacies include butter-brushed corn, dotted with an Espelette pepper and corn purée and finished tableside with summer truffle; classic-gone-grown up creations include a vanilla pasta with lobster, tarragon, black truffle sauce, and Satsuma powder. Seared Wagyu topped with curls of green papaya, drops of tamarind, jackfruit, and coconut purées displays a harmony between sweet and savory.A sphere of cherry blossom mousse arrives with a cake base, tonka bean gelée topping, and cherry sorbet for a stunning final bow.

Chef Edward Kim has a vivid imagination and his cooking takes detours through delicious landscapes. Start with empanadas full of Oaxacan cheese, kimchi, and served with a chimichurri-crème fraïche. Then, calamari bokum is wok-fried with spicy gochujang, crisped potatoes, and topped with crushed peanuts, but for a soothing signature, opt for boat noodles in a beef shank broth with pickled serrano chiles, prik phon rua, and fried shallots. Do keep an eye out for the special Chinese New Year menu.
"
688,"If you think you know what to order from this kitchen because you’ve been to Oaxaca, just wait a minute and listen to your fellow diners. They too have made the journey and their knowledge could probably draw a map of the city. Located in the heart of Little Saigon, this quiet restaurant has been thriving thanks to a clientele who knows quality when they taste it.The likes of soft, just-steamed pork tamales with a delicately spiced green mole; or wide, crackly tlayudas piled high with chorizo are presented to your table with the utmost care. The focused menu may have a number of highlights but one favorite is the Cornish hen roasted until its skin is crisp as a chip and then smothered with a dark, faintly sweet mole made from a riot of layered spices.
"
689,"There comes a point when a pared-down style jumps from being easy-to-miss and becomes hard-to-forget. When a lack of any FOH staff means the service is playfully all-hands-on-deck. When the explicit rap music reflects the chefs’ ethos, going well beyond laissez-faire to the point of “we don’t give a damn.” You probably won’t either once you taste the food. Not every dish works, but when it does, the result is sublime.Making a mark on this menu is the basil julep accompanied by a light cloud of basil-scented air and compressed mozzarella with caviar; as well as hiramasa atop tapioca dotted with egg yolk sauce. Your finale may feature a quirky spin on Fruit Loops by way of an oat-and-coriander cookie with coconut gel and finger lime.
"
690,"Don’t let the name fool you. This isn’t a lederhosen-wearing, beer stein-waving sort of spot. Instead, imagine a former warehouse-turned-chic setting for German-rooted, Southern-slanted food. The fact this is complemented by an ace beer selection, Bavarian-inspired cocktails, and wine list worth a deeper look simply adds to the allure.Begin with garlic pretzel knots, served with mustard sauce and a pimento cheese dip for that signature Southern departure from German tradition. House-cured ham with smoked trout aïoli is tender to the point of creamy; pork sausage has that satisfying snap; and French onion spaetzel, in a caramelized onion béchamel, is utterly creative. Delicately charred pork chop set atop sauerkraut is a feast fit for more than one. 
"
691,"This quaint spot from Chef Ryan Brosseau pays homage to his French-Canadian mémé, Margaret, and fittingly, resembles a grandma's house. If you're envisioning a blue-painted façade, white-trim windows, and framed paintings all set below a decorative ceiling, you're starting to get the picture here. A small bar in the back and engaging staff keep things homey and abuzz.This is a French-Canadian menu that goes beyond poutine and cheese curds. Comfort and decadence are at the heart of such shareable plates as an heirloom tomato salad starring fromage blanc, pickled shallots and dressed with black garlic-ice wine vinegar. Nanaimo bars are a sweet and salty confection with a graham cracker crumb, cocoa powder and walnut—all finished with chocolate ganache.
"
692,"It’s a charming irony that an establishment whose name translates as “Vietnamese Restaurant” manages to stand out in a neighborhood that's packed to the brim with competing options. As soon as you enter, there’s a sense of easy hospitality—akin to that of being welcomed to a relative’s dining table—which is matched rather perfectly by their careful, homespun cooking.Though this menu is voluminous, standbys like spring rolls and pho are a cut above, and those nostalgic for a taste of home food (or eager to try something new) will find themselves especially rewarded. Less common dishes, like the ca kho to (caramelized catfish cooked in a clay pot) and goi vit (duck salad with herbs, peanuts, and fried shallots), have no shortage of devotees.
"
693,"Despite the frilly connotations, this sausage-and-beer haven's name refers not to doilies, but to the layers of foam that remain in the glass after your craft brew has been quaffed. You’ll also have plenty of time to study the lace curtains as you plow through their vast beer menu—go ahead and try a different one with each of your Bangers.This is finger food for the most part, as seen in the sweet and savory German-style bratwurst, tucked between slices of brioche and topped with caramelized onions, sauerkraut, and Bavarian mustard. A salt-freckled, crusty pretzel may then be enriched with creamy Welsh rarebit for a sumptuous balance. Smoked Thuringer laced with Swiss cheese and pickled currants is yet another instance of this kitchen's flavor prowess.
"
694,"The name is Thai for “eat rice,” and you’ll want plenty of it to mop up every last bite of this kitchen's perfectly spicy, salty, sweet and tangy Northern Thai dishes. Operated by chef siblings, Nova and Kami Sasi, this is a fun, lively spot, with graffiti-like signage, hip-hop in the background, and colorful murals bedecking the walls. Every item is perfectly balanced, from the crunchy and subtly spiced fishcakes with cucumber-herb salad to the glorious nam khao tod, featuring crispy rice with ground chicken, pork skin, plenty of fresh ginger, cilantro and green onion.As a bonus, it’s also BYOB, so bring along a crew of friends with a couple of six-packs, and you'll be able to conquer most of the small menu—along with a few specials listed on the board.

695,"Husband and wife Son Do and Chinh Pham tell stories of their childhood in Saigon at this gem on bustling Belmont. The moniker is a marriage of their names, which not only enhances the charm factor but also makes total sense considering they were high school sweethearts. A set of glass doors marks the entry to this bright, modern space, fitted with a leather banquette and lush, colorful planters.The menu is modern Vietnamese with a focus on ingredient sourcing. Dishes display immense depth, so come hungry to sample the duck salad with banana blossoms; or pho, that national treasure, with bone broth, flat rice noodles, Wagyu short rib and aromatics aplenty. Desserts may change, but if the cassava cake or coffee flan are on offer, jump on it. 
"
696,"It might come as a surprise that this sleek, good-looker shares the same owners as next-door Schubas Tavern. And like a tavern, its menu paints broad strokes to appeal to a wide range. Start off with a smoked trout and artichoke dip served with house-made salt and vinegar chips before tucking in to the butternut squash schnitzel. Baked, breaded and fried butternut squash served over spaetzle tossed in brown butter with sauerkraut, hazelnuts and cranberries is a delicious riff on the classic. . Of course, this kitchen can do so much more and flexes its culinary muscles in other dishes, like fried sweet potato with salsa macha and cumin yogurt or a winning Spanish mackerel set on coconut-braised garbanzo beans and garnished with fistfuls of parsley and mint.
"
697,"This hot mama greets diners with a marble bar along with an enticing cabinet display of premium conservas, oils, and spices. A series of top cocktails and sherries merely add to the allure. Set towards the back, the dining room is a visual masterpiece, thanks to plush red banquettes, vintage rugs, bright Moorish tiles, and wrought-iron chandeliers.The kitchen is focused on cooking that is both ingenious and satisfying. To wit: foie gras, tucked into a ""taco shell"" composed of almonds and orange peel, is matched with membrillo; while pulpo canario is served with confit baby potatoes and chicharrón-infused olive oil. Albeit traditional, desserts like the tarta de Santiago (almond-flour cake with apple sorbet) deliver singular twists and turns.
"
698,"Though it’s named for an obscure wine grape, this dressed-up Southern Italian eatery dishes up crowd-pleasing fare, from wood-fired pizzas to charcuterie and pastas. Its hefty brown leather booths are designed for snuggling into with a group, while the massive front bar draws solo diners to commune with a bowl of outstanding nettle and ricotta ravioli.Pizza lovers will thrill to the Neapolitan pies, including the classic Margherita as well as a spicy diavola. Served piping-hot from the oven, with scissors for cutting at the table, they’re ideal for sharing. But any peace accords may be broken at dessert, when tables fight over bites of the s’mores-inspired caramel budino, with its addictive chocolate graham and toasted marshmallow topping. 
"
699,"Chef Zubair Mohajir's culinary respite is a delicious and welcome surprise. The small, intimate, and historic ""coach house"" brings a myriad of new flavors and layers of complexity to the cuisines of both South- and Southeast Asia. Born in India and raised in the Middle East, before settling down in Chicago with his family, he pivoted from finance to—his true calling—cooking.Pickling and fermentation play a vital role on the menu, as evident in the array of achars. Most recently, we were enticed by a pavé of sweet potato with a dry spice rub (molaga podi) as well as fara (dumplings) with beet butter and earthy shiitakes. Desserts, like ube jalebi soaked in saffron syrup and served with pistachio ice cream, speak of worlds colliding and has palates tingling.
"
700,"Make your way to this urban enclave—replete with a cherished counter and soaring skylights—for impressive sushi, small plates, and specialty Japanese cocktails. The window display of bamboo, moss, and river stones is a symbol of welcome serenity on this ever-changing stretch. Aside from its standout façade and sleek interior, Arami draws a crowd for Chef Ismael L. Lopez's nightly selection of sashimi and nigiri.Kick things off with a spicy tako maguro maki filled with octopus, tuna, eel sauce, and chili oil; or marinated tuna-wrapped zuke maguro kani.

Colorful wicker seating at the dining room’s communal table gives groups an authentic experience, while picture windows offer plenty of people-watching for everyone.Vegetarian and omnivorous offerings abound on the menu, which also features a small glossary of terms to help newcomers. Pleasantly spicy yesiga wot combines tender chunks of beef with onions and ginger in a rich berbere sauce.

702,"How does one walk past a window, where a focused sfoglina may be found busy twirling strands of beautiful busiate? You don't. You walk right in—to a world where pasta is king. This team is not out to revolutionize Italian food; instead, they are trying to correct some of its misinterpretations. And the results, while simple, are always delicious. Dishes feature some exceptional products, as seen in smoked eggplant with roasted peppers and ricotta salata. Focaccia makes a fine match to the latter, not unlike the guanciale-infused all'arrabbiata that adorns twists of casarecce.The long and narrow room houses a smattering of brightly covered seats, a striking black-and-white tiled floors, and shelves full of oils, salts, and vino. What more can one ask for?

Its enormous arched windows open up to a completely revamped 100-year-old room, featuring long exposed ceiling beams, whitewashed brick, dark slate walls and soft leather chairs.But even with all that design swag, the main draw at Pearl’s Southern Comfort is still the food. For starters, there’s the ace barbecue, but guests should hardly stop there. Try the enormous double cut pork chop, grilled to supple perfection and paired with “dirty” farro salad, Cajun slaw and pork jus.

This is killer food, elevated and prepared with care.The kitchen turns out both a three- and five-course prix-fixe dinner at tremendous value, but Chef/owner Patty Neumson’s cooking is light (and delicious) enough to go the distance. A sample menu might begin with a cool pile of crunchy green papaya, carrot and cucumber, laced in a beautifully balanced lime dressing with vermicelli noodles and peanuts. Then move on to tofu and kabocha in a deliciously complex coconut curry full of wilted basil and heat. Soft glass noodles find their match in sautéed onions, fresh crab and crunchy shrimp.
"
707,"Husband-and-wife chefs Tim Flores and Genie Kwon have branched out to launch this iteration of their culinary dreams. The dinner tasting, which is an evolution of their wildly popular café, reflects their training, experience and heritage. Naturally, the result is an ambitious, clever and distinct meal, where traditional Filipino food is given a creative spin in such items as maitake mushroom adobo with mussel emulsion; ""pancit"" reflecting Spanish influence with Serrano ham; and an elegant take on ""halo-halo"" combining Asian pear granita, pandan ice cream and freeze-dried mandarin.The design is clear upon entry—an impressively equipped kitchen framed by a counter where diners watch the action unfold. Banquettes tucked under the windows make for plush seats.
"
708,"A whitewashed façade and verdant planters welcome diners to this warm and intimate dining room. In contrast, the interior feels more industrial, by way of large steel vats of beer, for which this bijou is clearly beloved. Other furnishings include a long, welcoming bar lined with green tiles, an array of seats, as well as a semi-open blazing with action.This is cooking that's certainly both excellent and exciting. Taste the splendor behind the top-shelf ingredients in a seared tuna salad with crunchy greens, sweet mango, and soft avocado. Oven-roasted artichokes may then appear, elegantly plated and deliciously tender; while bone-in ribeye is brought to life with a side of cauliflower. Top it all off with a slice of ultra-gratifying banana cream pie.
"
709,"After traveling across India, Chef Marisa Paolillo was sufficiently inspired to return stateside and open a restaurant that celebrates its culinary diversity. Named for the country’s most popular condiment, everything here—from the colorful artwork to the rich curries—shows a deep appreciation for the sub-continent.The well-priced tasting offers an array of specialties. There is also a spring à la carte as well as a seven-course prix-fixe. Regardless of your pick, expect flavorful dishes that are a riff on the classics. Think of the onion-tomato sauce of butter chicken, ramped up with mushrooms and sundried tomatoes for a Mediterranean twist. Chana masala is spiked with ginger and garlic, while beef nihari spotlights a succulent black cardamom sauce.
"
710,"As if we needed more evidence that vegan cuisine is alive and thriving, along comes this breezy retreat. Chef/owner Rodolfo Cuadros (of Amaru) is in the saddle, while the staff are always on the ball, presenting diners with a menu full of flavor and textural complexity. This is a vast space, with greenery, funky light fixtures, and that beloved counter. A perch here will ensure you're in full view of the team as they work closely with a host of pristine ingredients.Baja tacos underscore a tortilla made from hemp seed and filled with fried banana blossom; while kelp noodles with acorn squash velouté and pumpkin seeds are wholesome yet wholly gratifying. Avocado-Key lime ""ice cream"" with ginger crumbles is an electrifying finish.
"
711,"A laid-back neighborhood spot at heart, the interior here is unfussy, with wood paneling and exposed ceilings. And although the vibe is relaxed, the cooking is anything but, thanks to top ingredients and careful techniques. The ""Neapolitan-inspired"" pizza may not be made in the traditional wood-burning oven, but those electric deck ovens still manage to turn out deliciously puffy and lightly charred crusts. They are a nod to Naples, but don't forget to sample the rotating selection of pastas, which hail from Sicily to Umbria (from whence the parpardelle alla Norcina with a sauce of cream and sausage originates).The compact menu features pizzas and pastas as main attractions, but desserts too impress, as in the fior di latte sundae or classic tiramisu.
"
712,"Dining here is like attending an underground dinner party prepared by a merry band of misfit cooks in Chef Phillip Foss’ home (he lives upstairs). There is one seating, everyone is served at the same time, and meals are prepaid so guests can linger. The BYOB policy merely reinforces the restaurant's resemblance to a test kitchen.The cuisine works wonders by pushing—if not completely disregarding—traditional boundaries. For instance, a croquette filled with Caesar dressing and set on romaine is to be eaten by licking the plate; while oil-poached salmon with everything spice draped atop a ""bagel purée"" is served with dill and cream cheese meringue. The French fries and ice cream course, designed to look like a milkshake, is ingenious and unforgettable.
"
713,"After years of searching for a brick-and-mortar home, Chef Trevor Teich landed upon this welcoming Bucktown location. Named after his mother, Claudia is über cool and contemporary. Modern art adorns its walls and midnight-blue velvet covers the booths. Tables up front are tightly spaced but ideally situated to face the kitchen, where the synchronized team prepares an intensely creative prix-fixe.The bento box—featuring the likes of a scallop cracker with preserved egg yolk, squid ink madeleine and a caviar-topped potato beignet—sets the stage for a memorable experience. Tempura-fried snails with black truffle and woodsy pine-flavored meringue is a legacy favorite, while pâté en croûte is flaky, buttery and oh so addictive.
"
714,"This is everything you want from your favorite neighborhood restaurant—warm, convivial, and never excessive. The fact that its food exists at a level far above the easygoing vibe is an extra-special bonus. The timeless menu has pivoted in the hands of Chef Larry Feldmeier, with ace ingredients, delightful flavor combinations, and fine presentations. Begin with an artistic mingling of sweet melon, aged prosciutto, crisp endive, and red wine vinaigrette. Pasta chitarra may then be enhanced with anchovies, chili pepper, and herbs; while halibut tempura is coddled with yuzu aïoli and a fiery chili sauce.The buttery Basque cake with Campari-compressed strawberries and almond-crème fraîche may arrive at the skilled hands of Pastry Chef Julia Fitting.
"
715,"Featuring exposed brick with travel mementos, artwork, and other curios, Gadabout feels like a quirky boutique. The name is a clue to its culinary style—free-wheeling, fun-loving, and happily unbound. The result is a carte of global flavor combos. To start, fingerling potatoes with tamarind chutney and chaat masala may just transport you to an Indian streetside cart. Corn and poblano empanadas with mango-blueberry salsa reflect the sunny savors of Latin America. The final leg of this trip will have you waxing poetic about the brown butter blondies with miso butterscotch.This globetrotting affect extends to the cocktails, like Chicago’s favorite bitter digestive Malört in a tiki-style quencher; or heather-infused whisky recalling Scotland's rugged hills.
"
716,"Boasting a refreshed interior and an open kitchen equipped with extra gadgets, this big kid on the block greets guests with barrel-aged punch selections, as well as an impressive list of Bourbon and whiskey. From its cookbook collection to brocade walls lined with portraits of life in the South, the place oozes warmth and is a guaranteed good time. Yes, it’s no front porch in Louisiana, but it’s certainly close.The menu too is rooted in the South, but as often as the chef trots out his grandmother's heirloom recipes, he dishes out creative tweaks, many with Mexican influences. Cheddar-corn fritters with a chili pepper-vinegar dip and bread pudding are staples, while the hen and hominy presents a south-of-the-border slant on chicken and dumplings. 
"
717,"This distinguishable exterior is marked by a sea of Mediterranean blue and wall-to-wall array of glass-paneled doors that open onto the street. Inside, all eyes are drawn to the sleek wood-burning hearth, in turn enclosed by a low blue-tiled wall that partitions off the open kitchen. Other walls echo the azure hues of the façade. That hearth isn't just a decorative element here. In fact, this Israeli-inspired menu boasts pillowy pita with hummus and burnished roast cauliflower, both of which emerge flame-kissed from the oven. Dishes also unveil classics from the greater Near East, including Georgia. Behold the piping-hot and deliciously rich khachapuri. The bar, set just beyond, is beloved for its excellent drafts and thoughtful natural wine selection.
"
718,"Secreted away in one of the many alleyways in Ukranian Village and amidst scores of other venues, this is an alfresco dinning delight. Takeaway is the other alternative, when the weather isn't right. Regardless, the space is especially unique, thanks to a few garden tables and trestles with hanging plants.Chef Noah Sandoval is involved with this project and his talent is clearly under the spotlight, as evidenced by the delicious pan pizzas, salads, and sandwiches. Don't miss out on a pizza square with soppressata, Castelvetrano olives, and maitake mushrooms. A sandwich, featuring perfectly charred rapini, Taleggio, Agrumato, and Calabrian chili, is yet another taste-bud tease. Cool things down with a Pizzaberry tonic and bottle of bubbly Topo Chico.
"
719,"Nostalgia is alive and well inside the colorful dining room, complete with oceanic hues, soft cushions, vibrant artwork and a U-shaped bar. A large dining area with proper tables is perfect for groups, while a semi-private nook serves family-style plates.This throwback is a loud and happy place, thanks to an extensive menu of heartwarming Chinese-American classics. Crab rangoon and shrimp chips make an appearance, but don't miss those luscious dan dan noodles or ""special combo"" fried rice, studded with cubes of pork, shrimp and more. The bone-in pork shank with black bean sauce and charred cabbage is designated a ""special"" for good reason, and fried string beans in a rich, savory broad bean purée are a must. Finish with the sesame cake with jasmine and orange.  
"
720,"Missouri kid Robert Shaner is the chef/owner of this culinary haven. The name, which translates to ""Robert &amp; Son,"" is a tribute to his father; and having spent time in Paris with his entire family, the menu is—fittingly—classic French with creativity at the forefront. Detailed elegance is the name of the game, especially when it comes to house-made breads, like a fluffy black garlic brioche paired with foie gras terrine. A small, frequently changing menu may feature hearty mains, like quail assembled as a roulade wrapped around foie gras and black truffle. Desserts from pastry chef Cati Molnar are a particular highlight, whereby sunflower Paris-Brest spotlights a crackling seed-studded rye choux pastry and praline ice cream, drizzled with sunflower honey.
"
721,"As the name suggests, this remarkable operation offers a serious caviar spread at a nicely varied price range, but it’s the carefully crafted dishes of Guy Meikle that will have you planning your return visit. The talented chef brings balance and sophistication to Eastern European cooking, intricately weaving Southeast Asian ingredients into staples like kimchi or nam prik.Dinner might kick off with great house-made black bread, or pan-seared pierogies with wild mushrooms, crème fraîche, mustard, and a cherry-black pepper gastrique. Carnivores won't be disappointed by the tender lamb- and shiitake-mandu laced with black garlic, apple purée, and ramp aïoli; or the short rib glazed in a lingonberry demi-glacé and coupled with dainty, oval-shaped dumplings.
"
722,"The romantic ideal of a French bistro is alive and well at quaint Bistro Campagne, where a tiny bar by the entrance is ready with your aperitif. Light slants through wooden Venetian blinds, bouncing off cream-and-brick walls in the welcoming dining room. Choose a white cloth-covered table inside or dine outside under the garden’s twinkling lights and green tree branches.Inspired accompaniments make for memorable versions of rustic French standards. Start with a large, savory bowl of soupe à l’oignon gratinée capped with a thick layer of melting Gruyère. Then, discover their pitch-perfect duck pithiviers, wild mushroom duxelles and hazelnuts in puff pastry with a Madeira reduction. Brown butter pain perdu tucked with black figs is moist and delicious.
"
723,"All neighborhood restaurants should aspire to be more like The Warbler. This latest venture from the team behind gather is located just next door, and features a dining room that is far more sleek and contemporary than you might expect. Yet it remains as comfy as ever, helping it become an instant staple.The playful cooking clearly shows effort as seen in their house-made pastas and artistic plating, but is always accessible and appealing. Chitarra twirled around blistered tomatoes in a buttery garlic sauce with shrimp are not only delicious but reasonably priced. The menu is also full of American classics like wings, nachos and flatbreads, but save room for desserts—like a carrot cake drenched in so much toffee sauce, it may as well be called a pudding.
"
724,"A chic, cozy space lets guests get up close and personal at gather. Diners seeking dinner and a show take front row seats at barstools lining the open kitchen’s polished granite counter, while tall communal tables fill with patrons enjoying bites from the menu’s “gather and share” section. A rear dining room offers more solitude and romance.Family-style Sunday dinners are a local draw, but the à la carte menu showcases flavorful options nightly. Slice into a single large uovo raviolo to mingle poached egg and ricotta with white truffle butter, jalapeño slivers and chopped chives, or share a crock of Pernod-splashed mussels. Fragrant and garlicky, they’re served with sourdough toast points for soaking up every last drop of the white wine-cream sauce.
"
725,"Don’t be fooled by the no-frills interior of this homey little soul food spot. Yes, you order at the counter; and yes, you’ll be helping yourself to utensils, napkins and ice water. However, Luella’s is cooking up anything but fast food. This earnest kitchen makes your order from scratch, and it’s more than worth the wait. The surrounding artwork is half the fun anyway: you might even recognize prints like “Sugar Shack” by artist Ernie Barnes from the 1970’s sitcom, “Good Times.”The tender buttermilk-fried chicken is a thing of beauty, served with warm collards braised with ham hock. Then pillowy biscuits, cooked to order and served with apricot jam, are pure bliss; as are Mississippi hot tamales stuffed with Slagel Farms beef and melted cheddar cheese.
"
726,"Sticky Rice stands out—not only for its focus on Northern Thai specialties, but also for the quality and abundance of dishes made to order. Sunny and citrus-hued, it’s the kind of place where those who dare to step outside their satay-and-pad Thai comfort zone will be greatly rewarded.Luckily, the extensive menu makes it easy to do just that. Tender egg noodles absorb the fragrant coconut curry in a bowl of kow soy that’s redolent of citrusy coriander and served with pickled greens and cilantro. Duck larb is zippy and full of spice, with an unforgettable tart-and-sweet dressing. Hint: use the spot’s namesake sticky rice to temper the heat while soaking up every last drop.Food is prepared to order, so speed is not worshipped at this BYOB spot.
"
727,"Open since 2014, this osteria has become an area staple, thanks to its charming space and focused menu that displays a keen eye on hearty Piedmontese cuisine. The staff is as welcoming as the design, which features a garage-like glass façade, glowing bulbs that protrude from the walls, bare wood tables and metal chairs lining the floor.For starters, we’re partial to the thin slivers of poached beef arranged around a tangy tonnato, but just as tempting is the cauliflower and leek flan. Pastas are, of course, made-in house and the specialty is no doubt the tajarin, a plate of deliciously eggy noodles twirled high with a savory ragù. Other regional specialties include hand-pinched ravioli stuffed with la tur cheese as well as prosciutto-wrapped rabbit loin.
"
728,"After several years at Topolobampo, the husband-wife duo behind this gem have taken their knowledge and skills to craft this consistently delicious and inventive cuisine. And, the chefs’ deep understanding of Mexican ingredients has allowed them to create elegant and well-priced compositions. Chunks of slowly braised pork carnitas are hearty, tender and brought to an entirely new level with squash that pops with bright flavor—all balanced with a bracing tomatillo broth. For dessert, indulge in an excellent Mexican sugar pie topped with whipped cream and pecan toffee that is out of this world.The space is comfortable and roomy, so that the steady stream of thirty-somethings never make it feel crowded. Curved booths and romantic lighting lend a warm vibe.
"
729,"The name was your first clue. The cutout of a pig hanging over the door was your second. Specializing in whole hog, snout to tail butchery, this all-day salumeria offers a dazzling selection of charcuterie arranged on wooden boards or layered on soft deli bread. Such craftsmanship is in full view of the dining room, which includes a curing chamber filled with rows of soppressata, finocchiona, and Spanish chorizo. Truffled lardo with rosemary is a must. Need a vegetable? Try the salad with broccolini and zucchini tossed in a tarragon-green goddess dressing.The historic building, with its honeycomb tiled floors and original wood joists, offers a charming old-world vibe. Weekend dinner strikes closer to a bistro with steak frites and duck leg confit.
"
730,"A fresh chapter has commenced at this venerable establishment, where new ownership in Tim Lacey and Executive Chef Ian Jones keep the spirit alive and kicking. The space showcases a simple, cozy aesthetic with cork-brown cement floors, chunky wood tables, and sleek white walls. But the highlight, as always, is the open kitchen shielded by a low wall decked out with potted plants.The tasting menu is a lengthy affair, bestowing fans new and old with a parade of whimsical bites, snacks, and mains. Ambition and creativity keep things interesting; while inspiration hails from near and far. Duck breast with caramelized sunchokes may be paired with a confit-filled bastilla; while brined and smoked Ibérico pork is composed with grilled cabbage and apple butter.
"
731,"This charming nook of a restaurant greets its guests with the intoxicating aromas of za’atar focaccia wafting from a wood-burning oven that anchors the space. It’s the kind of advertising that all but demands you order it—and how glad you will be when you do, as it arrives with a trio of creamy dips like tzatziki, hummus, and caponata. While sister-restaurant Osteria Langhe focuses strictly on the cuisine of Piedmont, this kitchen weaves Italian pastas, like cacio e pepe and tortellini amatrciana, with more broadly Mediterranean hits, like lamb kefta with labneh as well as Moroccan chicken with root vegetables.The patio is a breezy retreat for groups, while the dining room inside is a cozy, date night-worthy setting with globe lights and hardwood floors.
"
732,"Boasting a lively, charming ambience; friendly, knowledgeable service; and a delicious menu courtesy of Chef/owner Diana Dávila, Mi Tocaya is a welcome addition to the burgeoning Logan Square food scene. Bring friends, order a clever seasonal cocktail, try something from the menu and you’ll no doubt leave with a renewed love for Mexican cuisine.The short but intriguing listing of “small cravings” (antojitos) is influenced by the less-explored Aztec cuisine. Sample dishes like guisado de nopalitos, a fragrant, earthy stew with cactus, zucchini and charred chilies, served with delicious knobs of salt-dusted fried cheese curds and warm corn tortillas. But don’t overlook the warm tacos, sure to transport you to the streets of Mexico City.
"
733,"Tucked into a tiny strip mall in the West Edgewater-Upper Andersonville area, San Soo Gab San has generated quite a buzz among serious Korean food fans. Inside, you’ll find a warm, welcoming space with large tabletop grills to cook your own meats.Most excitingly, the authentic, traditional dishes turned out of the kitchen don’t bow or cater to Western sensibilities—to wit, an incredibly flavorful bowl of piping hot goat meat soup arrives with wild sesame leaves and a flutter of seeds. Among the many popular casseroles and stews, don’t miss the beoseot doenjang jjigae, chockablock with tender tofu, savory mushrooms, beef and veggies. The delicious barbecue is perfect for a group feast or those looking to have some fun with their food.
"
734,"This Mexican institution specializes in a single item—birria—tender stewed goat accompanied by diced onions, cilantro, and house-made salsa. In fact, goat is all that’s on the menu, though you’ll get a few options as to how to enjoy it: on a plate or in a bowl, in a small or large portion, bone-in or bone-out. Opt for bone-in if possible, as it packs far more flavor.The bowl option drowns the goat in a generous dose of hearty goat consommé, while the plate is accompanied by handmade corn tortillas for build-your-own tacos, with a small side of consommé for dipping. You can’t go wrong either way, but if you’re feeling extra decadent, go for the goat quesadilla, a perfect trinity of pillowy tortillas, gooey cheese, and savory goat meat goodness. 
"
735,"Fans of the late Fat Rice will be happy to see the restaurant’s return by way of this casual second act. The open kitchen and generous bar seating remain, though diners now order at a counter before finding a perch at the communal high-top or along the edge of the room.Cantonese-style char siu pork collar and jumbo shrimp with chili-garlic arrive with fluffy coconut rice and aggressively charred scallions. Wide, house-made rice noodles are either steamed or wok-seared, before being paired with the likes of minced soy sauce beef, smoked tofu, or smoked mushrooms. It is, by all means, very easy to over-order, but under no circumstance should diners skip those egg custard tarts. Warm and creamy, they are a holdover recipe that is perfection personified.
"
736,"Equal parts sophisticated Asian eatery and brewpub, BiXi has style to spare—with a glamorous, sun-soaked and plant-filled atrium of a dining room. Named for one of the nine sons of the Dragon King in Chinese mythology, its house brews often incorporate Eastern ingredients, like the dried mango and black tea that infuse a golden pale ale.The menu is equally inventive, fusing Chinese and Chicago cuisines in creations like a Prime rib-stuffed bao with Sichuan-spiced giardiniera. The house-made Yibin-style belt noodles are equally irresistible, thanks to a generous helping of umami-rich fermented black beans. And for dessert, indulge in a mountain of coffee-cinnamon soft-serve accompanied by caramel and crispy puffed rice—it's big enough for four.
"
737,"In a neighborhood stacked with restaurant favorites, this cozy little hangout is sure to become another one. The cooking is hard to nail down: from chicken liver mousse with orange marmalade to kefta-spiced cauliflower with chimichurri and romesco, Chef Sam Engelhardt doesn’t seem interested in limiting himself to just one corner of the world—and we aren’t complaining.Creative pairings like Prime steak with fish sauce caramel or halibut with sake-dill beurre blanc are approachable and delicious. In a hurry? Sit at the bar and go for the smash burger with roasted Kennebec potatoes. Servers exude a welcoming, come-as-you-are vibe in this boxy space, designed like a stylish pub with its dark wood tables, gold and silver-streaked walls, and vintage mirrors.
"
738,"Kids, friends, neighbors—everyone seems to adore Daisies, and what’s not to love? With its tiny but earnest and hardworking kitchen, clean, mid-century modern design and decidedly affordable prices, this local charmer can do no wrong. Pastas reign supreme here, so much so that even gluten-free options are available. Hungry patrons should kick off a meal with the house onion dip or fried mushrooms with cheese curds, both of which flaunt the kitchen’s playful side. Then linger over such hearty favorites as tajarin carbonara or mezzaluna stuffed with fermented squash and lamb.This team shows just as much effort during brunch: a fluffy cloud of scrambled eggs mixed with black truffle ricotta and set atop toast may just be nominated as one of the best bites.
"
739,"There is more than one way to enjoy this handsome Greek looker, set just off Logan Square Park. Some make an entire meal out of the mezze by swiping warm pita through dips, like creamy whipped feta, smoky charred eggplant, and creamy taramasalata. Others might zero-in on that hulking platter of grilled lamb chops. Then again, a few may stick to the gyro and save themselves for impressive sweets, like custard pie with phyllo, or baklava froyo with pistachio sauce. In the end, no detail goes unnoticed in this breezy space flaunting sleek concrete floors, dangling greenery, and a wood-burning oven that kisses nearly everything on the menu.Even the wine list is Greek, thanks to an extensive selection of producers from Macedonia to Santorini.
"
740,"Brought to you by Jason Vincent, this fabulous and friendly restaurant is the epitome of Chicago. Its menu is a listing of familiar dishes (think onion rings, crab salad and baby back ribs), albeit drummed up with unique accents reflecting the chef’s distinctive style. The petite space is simple and lovely, with a modern-rustic décor and genuinely cozy neighborhood vibe. A chef’s counter in the back offers an up-close-and-personal kitchen experience.Kick things off with the excellent Jonah crab salad, served with soft waffle-cut potato fritters and freshly made cocktail sauce. Then move on to the “pici with chew,” where thick strands of noodles are cooked to a conservative al dente, and tossed with smoky bacon, chopped jalapeños and breadcrumbs.
"
741,"After five years of pop-ups and multiple kitchen pivots, this friendly restaurant has managed to stay both flexible and fun, which is also how we’d describe the cooking. Indian flavors are mixed and mashed in traditional and unconventional ways, as apparent in naan—a prominent menu fixture—topped with salted jalapeños and mozzarella, or reimagined as a calzone stuffed with butter chicken, brushed with ghee and finished with Maldon salt. It’s not all bread—fiery Kerala crab curry with flaky parotta and a vibrant chana chaat with tamarind and spice are equally impressive.A take-out window offering playful sandwiches during lunchtime is a boon for pedestrians. Exposed white brick, a long handsome bar and smooth warehouse floors make for an airy vibe.
"
742,"This neighborhood gem is just as it’s always been and regardless of whether you're squeezed into the main dining room with friends or seated solo at the spacious bar in the adjacent space, the charm of this mainstay endures. The evolving menu focuses on fresh, seasonal, and original fare, keeping it slammed from morning to night.Barbecued wedges of spaghetti squash topped with Asian pear, daikon, and sesame is impossible not to finish. Nicely grilled steaks are accompanied by a tangle of blistered long beans brushed in a house XO sauce with deliciously chewy bits of dried seafood for maximum flavor. Finish over a tall slice of double-layered carrot cake, complete with crème anglaise and a luxurious spoonful of strawberry preserves.
"
743,"Marked by an ampersand over the door, this operation is the ultimate merging of the Old World and New Order. It’s where remnants of a glorious past live in harmony with chefs who prefer bandanas and beards to toques; and the cuisine remains as ambitious as ever despite the room's saloon-like feel.Although lunch is limited, the kitchen remains busy at all times and the cocktail program—complete with rare Pappy Van Winkle whiskey—is exceptional. Creativity is at the center of each dish, like an addictive pile of Nashville hot crispy pig ears served with a tangy pickle juice remoulade. Dessert highlights like a hibiscus tart features a riff on the key lime pie, and is presented as a sweet mousse with smooth coconut sorbet, topped with crisp coconut chips.
"
744,"Second restaurants are typically bigger in size and ambition, but that's not so for Chef/owners Johnny Clark and Beverly Kim, who also run Parachute next door. The setup here is so modest that it's almost alarming—four courses and small bites, which change nightly and with no particular cuisine allegiance beyond whatever is on hand and tastes good together. There are no luxury supplements either, like truffles, Wagyu and no lengthy explanations about how your food should be eaten. It’s just seasonal cooking done right, in a cheerful space built out of reclaimed pine, felt finishes, and retro light fixtures.One night yielded a goat’s milk panna cotta with candied violets that, like the restaurant itself, sounded simple but turned out to be so much more.
"
745,"We could not rate this restaurant due to its prolonged closure. Our inspectors are eager to rediscover this address to share their experience. We invite you to consult Guide.Michelin.com, where information is regularly updated. Though there’s a distinctive Korean thread running through the menu, Parachute is an open-ended endeavor at heart. Impeccably sourced local ingredients lay the framework, but the husband-and-wife chef team, Johnny Clark and Beverly Kim's brilliant application of cutting-edge techniques takes the food to exciting new heights. 
"
746,"Rib tips may be the Windy City's cut of choice, but that means little to Chef Brian Bruns, whose brisket ranks among the best barbecue in town. Rubbed with salt and pepper before being set in a custom-built, 500-gallon barrel smoker for seven hours, the meat arrives so juicy and tender that you won’t even want for sauce. The restaurant has broadened its culinary scope as of late, but its strength continues to lie in all things meat. Charcuterie is a must-order, featuring the likes of chicken liver mousse wrapped in rich lardo or pork and date pâté.The rustic space, submerged with natural light streaming in from the windows, is decked out with wood beams and logs at every turn. An open kitchen with a hulking grill steals the spotlight in the back.
"
747,"Shortly after doors open at 11:00 A.M., the room fills with patrons eager to dig into smoking plates of 'cue. Once inside, peruse the chalkboard menu; then order cafeteria-style before staking your claim among the communal seating.The half-and-half sandwich, piled with pulled pork and brisket, is the best of both worlds, with chunky shreds of tender pork and spice-rubbed slices of pink-rimmed beef spooned with vinegary barbecue sauce. The usual side dish suspects like zingy, crisp coleslaw and deeply smoky baked beans are anything but standard here, complementing the ‘cue as they should. For a sweet finish, look no further than pecan bread pudding drizzled with salted caramel-Bourbon sauce.
"
748,"Far more authentic than the average chips-and-salsa joint, Sol de Mexico brightens the scene and palate with a lively atmosphere (cue the mariachi music) and delectable house specialties. Walls painted in tropical pinks, blues and oranges are a cheerful canvas for Dia de los Muertos artifacts. To sample the kitchen’s skill, start with sopes surtidos “xilonen”—four molded masa cups with a variety of fillings like caramelized plantains doused in sour cream, or tender black beans topped with crumbly house-made chorizo. Then, move on to the pollo en mole manchamanteles, which translates to “tablecloth stainer.” Rich and slightly bitter with a comforting nuttiness, the aptly named mahogany sauce begs to be sopped up with freshly made tortillas.
"
749,"When Raul Ortega started his taco truck in Boyle Heights back in 2001, he probably had no idea just how hard the city would fall for him. Today his Jalisco-inspired tacos have become a rite of passage, and he now runs a number of trucks around town, not to mention this modest but cherished spot in Pomona.The menu is the same everywhere, limited to tostadas piled with various lime-kissed ceviches. Inside tip: opt for his signature fried shrimp taco tinged with spicy salsa and creamy avocado slices. It's an unequaled version, complete with a crunchy shell that collapses like tempura, as well as a rich and savory filling. First-time customers start with a single order, while regulars get right to business with a whole plate of them.
"
750,"Set in the quaint village of Rancho Santa Fe, Mille Fleurs has been a longtime—over 30 years—haunt among locals celebrating special occasions. Its elegant piano bar is often filled with well-dressed visitors in town to watch the Del Mar races, while the courtyard patio strung with lights makes for a romantic setting, especially when watching the fireworks.French and German influences like spätzle and wiener schnitzel make their appearance on this market-driven menu. In fact, the chef makes a beeline for tradition with mains like lobster bisque and Dover sole. Even dessert veers classic, with straightforward and delicious selections like apple strudel.Five- and seven-course menus with wine pairings are also on offer and quite popular.
"
751,"Chef William Bradley's standard-setting dining room is exceedingly ambitious and his team is cooking world-class ingredients with exceptional skill, leaving you hungry for more. The tasting menu is marked by glorious presentations and enhanced by the harmonious application of global flavors.Addison's cuisine while constantly evolving also retains the chef's signature of incredible precision and polish. A quintet of opening bites show finely tuned flavors that are assertive but never overbearing. Imagine the likes of sake-cured kampachi with dashi meringue, Kumamoto oysters with pickled green strawberry, or potato rösti with Wagyu tartare. Other enticing entrées, like chawanmushi with sea scallops as well as caramelized cod with battera kombu, exemplify his masterful control over technique, flavors, and textures. Your meal may conclude with a selection of visually stunning small bites, including a petite peach tart with a fluted fruit leather ""shell"" and milk pudding filling. The rarefied mien of this setting suits the cooking beautifully—with plush marble columns and inlaid floors. Service is at its peak, combining genuine hospitality with gracious pacing.

752,"This Japanese import, whose first shop was opened in Akita Prefecture before spawning numerous offshoots, has been a local hit since day one. The first stateside location, it is set in a Clairemont strip mall and yet attracts a crowd; two more recent spin-offs, in Mira Mesa and Hillcrest, are similarly popular. Inside, one may expect efficient service and a no-frills vibe.On the menu, ramen is the main attraction. Diners are faced with few choices: the house broth is a rich, porky tonkotsu enhanced with miso; while the tantanmen is a unique take on Sichuan dan dan noodles, bolstered with ground pork and a touch of spice. Each item comes with excellent springy noodles and the option of add-ons—the ajitama egg, for instance, was a strong contender.
"
753,"Chef/owner Carl Schroeder is a La Jolla native with an encyclopedic knowledge of the region’s bounty. He’s been celebrating every locally sourced ingredient for over a decade now in this kitchen, and his repertoire of creative cooking continues to draw patrons for both special occasions as well as date night. The dark and seductive décor manages to be elegant without a hint of pretense, but one glance at the parking lot and you know that this spot is favored by a moneyed lot.Sushi is well-loved here, but it would be a shame to miss the chef’s creative and internationally influenced dishes. For instance, blue cheese soufflé with anise-orange marmalade shows off a European bent, while miso-glazed cod with shrimp dumplings is resoundingly Asian.
"
754,"You’ll be on the clock at this tiny sushi spot, where the omakase is priced at a straightforward dollar per minute—50 for 12 nigiri, or 90 for 18. But despite such punctuality, you will savor every bite here. In fact, you’ll find yourself slowing down to savor each and every creation from the talented chefs. However, seats here are hard to come by so be sure to reserve ahead of time or risk serious FOMO.Like other top-tier sushiyas, this one sources from across the globe: Peruvian scallops, Santa Barbara uni, and of course, plenty of Japanese species. A chalkboard menu keeps diners apprised of the current lineup, and for those who are still peckish after their tasting, there’s a bonus menu of handrolls and special seasonal nigiri for further sampling.
"
755,"Spicy Sichuan dishes are the name of the game at this spot, where the staff isn’t prone to small talk or smiles but regulars don’t seem to mind a bit. The food is solid and the portions are monstrous, leaving you with delicious leftovers for days.The menu is littered with colorful pictures of noodles, preserved chilies, steaming hot pots, sizzling platters, casseroles and crispy rice-crusted dishes. In other words, there’s something for everyone and it’s all made to order. Eggplant with garlic sauce is divine and even simple stir-fried string beans will have your palate tingling. Keep an eye out for specials scribbled on construction paper at the entrance; if you want the fish head, tell them when you enter, as it takes at least 40 minutes to prepare.
"
756,"The triumvirate of owners here may not be from Mexico, but thanks to time done in SoCal, they have a strong grasp over the nation's cuisine. Named for a town on the Baja California Peninsula, the eponymous gem brings a strong dose of magic to this mountainous terrain. Don't be fooled by its mall surrounds, as it's a verdant spot serving delicious food and creative sips—try the organic margarita to get what all the fuss is about.The staff is friendly and attentive to requests. Head to the patio when the sun is out to savor halibut tempura tacos with a salad of cabbage, avocado, and pico de gallo. The ""Veracruz vegetarian enchilada"" is another favorite, teeming with vegetables and salsa verde. Come rain or shine, caramel churros are a desirable finale.
"
757,"You won’t be gathering in a circle, but there is something heartwarming and enticing about Campfire. It could be the World War II-era Quonset metal hut that anchors the space, the teepee or the custom-built 12-foot wood-burning hearth. Whatever it is, it exudes that cool glamping vibe. Imagine servers in gingham shirts offering DIY s’mores, thermoses doubling as water pitchers, and even the check issued in a field notebook—this spot takes its campy theme quite seriously.The kitchen is no joke though. Diners may start with zesty crudo before moving on to a host of items that are either grilled, ember-roasted, or coal-smoked. This is cooking that smacks of an expert hand working the hearth.
"
758,"This self-described “Moroccan-Baja kitchen” might sound unusual, but it’s full of bold, enticing flavors. Inspired by both her local environs and family heritage, Chef Alia Jaziri turn outs a fascinating fast-casual menu. Delicacies include Moroccan-spiced chicken tacos dressed with preserved lemon and tzatziki-inspired crema, or couscous bowls layered with merguez, black beans, queso fresco and toasted pepitas. For those less inclined to fusion fare, the shakshuka (poached eggs in a spicy North African tomato sauce) is a faithful rendition.Though simple, this space has a coastal feel from skylights, a roll-up door, and relaxing color scheme of white, cyan and teal. Linger in the calm with a serving of baklava and rosewater-topped Greek fro-yo. 
"
759,"Partner John Resnick and Executive Chef Eric Bost are behind this very appealing and well-orchestrated French restaurant. Oozing with style and elegance at every turn, the name—which translates to “young and pretty”—could just as easily illustrate the clientele and décor here.Flaunting a nouvelle-French sensibility, the room is dressed in shades of rose and flooded with natural light. If that doesn’t sound alluring, envision such art deco details as a horseshoe-shaped velvet booth and terrazzo marble bar. The wide-open kitchen’s ""call and response"" method leads to the regular and audible “oui!” wafting throughout; and the food turned out by them is top-notch with a playful twist. This cooking however also displays a mature direction, with solid ingredients, unique combinations, and beautiful presentations. Broken into categories like Un, Deux, Trois, starters like white asparagus in a lemongrass glaze with fluffy sabayon and chive blossoms are as lovely to look at as they are to eat. Hay smoke-perfumed jidori chicken breast is then enriched by a sauce of morels and vin jaune.End on a graceful note with a feather-light dessert, featuring lime leaf sorbet, young coconut, and tapioca pearls.
"
760,"Flavio Piromallo has another hit on his hands with this hip North Park District spot. In keeping with its trendy surrounds, the décor sports an industrial-chic look with concrete floors, exposed pipes and a massive photographic elegy to Sophia Loren. Laid-back, cool service completes the experience. The modern affect belies its classic Southern Italian cooking. Neapolitan-style pizza is a favorite, and the homemade pastas have terrific flavor—ravioli con manzana is a delicious signature. Mandorle al Caffé, a spongy almond cake with a layer of espresso custard surrounded by a duo of white and black chocolate sauce, is a decadent way to end a satisfying meal. Lunchtime leans quiet, but come for dinner for a lively and entertaining scene.  
"
761,"Named for Chef Soichi Kadoya, who honed his skills at Old Town's Sushi Tadokoro, this intimate Japanese restaurant has made a name for itself in University Heights. Pale yellow walls and a light wood counter set an understated elegance. Discover a bit of magic as you glance out the window—that bamboo fence out front hides a small garden and water feature that is only visible through the window.There are two omakase options, as well as several à la carte items should you desire to supplement your meal. The chef may be animatedly chatting up diners, but make no mistake—this food shows serious focus. Sushi leans straightforward, but it is impressive and flaunts a great deal of skill. Pike mackerel, sourced from Hokkaido, is balanced by ginger and scallion, while kampachi delivers clean and simple flavors. Spanish bluefin tuna has a slight tang, while fatty tuna is more luscious. Sea bass, marinated with two kinds of miso, is served broiled and enticingly caramelized; and nigiri highlights trigger fish topped with a sliver of its creamy liver. An aromatic shirumono (fish soup) is the perfect transition before the homemade green tea ice cream. 
"
762,"This industrial Indonesian eatery is every bit as easy-breezy as its Oceanside hometown—imagine cheeky murals, dim lighting and a roll-up garage door entrance. But lest you consider it a divey drinking hole, be advised you’ll find some serious cooking here. Excellent nasi goreng combines fried rice with shrimp, pork belly, chicken and the yolk of a sunny egg, while charred eggplant with smoked tomato sambal and crispy fried shallots is a textural (and flavor-forward) delight.All that spice is sure to put you in the mood for a drink, and their creative cocktails deliver, with unique low-ABV beverages showcasing house-fermented shrubs and other elixirs. On weekends, brunch is replete with inventive, crowd-pleasing eats, like a chili-lime mango tartine. 
"
763,"This stylish neighborhood eatery is best enjoyed with those you ""trust"" most—and boasting a menu comprised of small plates, the theme here is all about sharing. On San Diego’s many fair-weather days, friends crowd onto the expansive patio to share Chef Brad Wise's delicious bites. His kitchen team relies primarily on the seasonal bounty of local farms to prepare such delights as hamachi tartare layered harmoniously with diced cucumber, smashed avocado and pea sprouts; or a fried chicken sandwich with shredded cabbage, house-made ssam sauce and hand-cut fries.When the weather turns colder, the industrial-cool dining room (complete with concrete and steel) is warmed by the glow of a wood-fired grill and softened by the upbeat mood of a chatty clientele. 
"
764,"Take the classic 50s diner, add a little swagger and you get Great Maple. It is one of four outlets statewide, but this particular location is always buzzing. Be warned though as parking and counter seats are coveted, so plan ahead.Three-course chef dinners on Mondays; burger and beer nights on Wednesdays; and prime rib Fridays are popular, but it’s also great at brunch. Fruity Pebbles pancakes, lolliwaffles on a stick and maple-bacon donuts are sweet-tooth satisfiers. Late night? Sip a Bloody Mary and tuck in to the brisket popover, a fluffy base with tender smoked meat, poached eggs and béarnaise that will cure what ails you. Seasonal dessert pies are all the rage—including the Valencia orange cream with a pistachio- and brown butter-shortbread crust.
"
765,"With the Mexican border just minutes away, you might be tempted to skip this homey spot for a more “authentic” meal in Tijuana. But the taco cognoscenti know that Chef Priscilla Curiel’s guisados are every inch the equal of Baja’s—down to the fair prices and hefty portions (and without the long traffic lines on your way home).Chef Curiel has amassed a cult following for her rich beef birria, crowned with a bone for scooping buttery marrow atop the taco. And yet, this menu has so many more delicious braises, like ""dirty style"" cochinita pibil with pickled red onion and cilantro, as well as the spicy longaniza sausage. Counter these heavy meats by topping your tortilla with lime and chili oil. Then prepare to enter taco heaven—no passport required. 
"
766,"Every element of this setting seems to exude a California-casual meets country-club vibe. Inside, choose from one of the Craftsman post-and-beam dining rooms, warm with amber lanterns and stained-glass light fixtures; or simply head outside to dine on the patio overlooking the pool and 18th hole of Torrey Pines Golf Course.The city's unending growing season means that there is a boundless harvest of local ingredients to inspire this kitchen. Begin with Dungeness crab flan surrounded by watercress, Belgian endive and roasted grapes, drizzled with tangy balsamic dressing. Then, indulge in elevated comfort foods like chicken under a brick, set over Tuscan kale and cannellini beans in tomato sauce. The brûléed lemon sabayon tart is above par and pure joy.
"
767,"Set in a converted home in the heart of Barrio Logan, this adorable osteria is a true family operation—Francesca Penoncelli, who hails from Turin, leads the kitchen, while her husband Mario, a Milan native, runs the front counter. Place your order in their quaint former living room, then snag a table in the welcoming, tree-lined courtyard, complete with a wood-burning pizza oven and fire pit.Despite their limited space, the kitchen team turns out an impressive menu, with more than a dozen handmade pastas (three of them gluten-free). You'll also want to sample the heavenly focaccia in a spicy, savory mascarpone-ricotta dip; decadently cheesy mushroom flan; and delicate tuna tartare, all paired with a glass from the heady Italian wine selection. 
"
768,"This Barrio Logan standout isn’t shy about projecting its personal brand of SoCal cool—from walls adorned with local art and skateboards, to a soundtrack that booms loud enough to be heard down the block. The substance behind the swagger, though, is what makes patrons line up: these are some of the best tacos in town. Classics like carne asada vie for attention alongside distinctly Californian options like a killer breakfast taco composed with corn and flour tortillas respectively—both are house-made and wonderfully fresh. Veggie options, like a chile relleno taco featuring charred poblano and fried cheese, are every bit as delicious.Seasonal agua fresca (spiked with tequila, or not) and a spectacular house Michelada will enhance your taco-fueled bliss.
"
769,"Cucina Urbana, like the other siblings in the Urban Kitchen Group family, is an amiable place that promises a good time. It’s casual, festive and draws regulars who flock here for their daily deals (Meatball Mondays are a favorite) and happy hour specials.Snacks are also aplenty. One sniff and you know truffle fries are big, but there’s also chicken liver pâté and black garlic hummus with crusty bread. Ribeye carpaccio is thinly sliced and ruby red; grilled octopus tentacle with speck, cashews, lemon yogurt and salsa verde is another winner. Neapolitan-style pizza with herbed ricotta, chopped bacon, sliced dates and a drizzle of sweet balsamic balances sweet and savory. Family-style dishes are the real deal, serving three to four. 
"
770,"It's named for the majestic oaks of nearby Presidio Park, but this Mission Hills eatery is no friend to trees—at least, not the ones that fuel its beast of a wood-burning hearth, through which nearly every item passes. Yet the arboreal sacrifice is a worthy one as Chef Brad Wise puts the flames to good use in his fresh and uncomplicated preparations. Think: French-style halibut with squash blossoms or Southern chicken-fried quail with redeye gravy.Just don't let the fire fool you—Fort Oak is no log cabin. This historic, former car dealership space is bright and airy, complete with a glamorous horseshoe-shaped bar and sleek, mid-century vibe. Drop in for a casual brunch or happy-hour drink, before splurging on an intimate “chef’s experience” tasting. 
"
771,"There may be plenty of taquerias around town, but this East Village gem is of a slightly different breed. The airy space, with its high ceilings, concrete floors and a full bar with lounge, reads über-cool. However, it’s more than just about good looks—their tacos are what draw the crowds. The variations on offer here lean more sophisticated with creative combinations such as baby carrot adobada and squash blossom relleno. Ribeye carne asada cooked to order on the mesquite wood-burning grill or achiote-rubbed pork belly with grilled pineapple are just some of the winners. Posole verde is comfort in a bowl, while fried masa disks are plain delectable.Remember to save room for the Mexican mole-chocolate ice cream and addictively crunchy churros.
"
772,"Brother and sister team—Uthan Dejcomrunkul and Jumi Pitiwartarlai—have made it their mission to bring the authentic flavors of the Isaan region of Northeastern Thailand to San Diego, and this East Village outpost clearly succeeds. You'll be hard-pressed to make a wrong choice on the  menu, whose small assortment of dishes are each made with unmistakable pride.Diners might start with spicy fermented pork sausage (nicely paired with a side of purple sticky rice and an ice-cold Singha); then move on to a spin on khao soi, or coconut curry noodles, given extra heft thanks to a crispy leg of duck confit subbing in for the typical chicken. Finish on a sweet note with house-made taro ice cream, served over coconut sticky rice sprinkled with toasted flakes.
"
773,"Chef Travis Swikard comes back to his hometown wreathed in glory, having earned his wings helming restaurants for culinary icon Daniel Boulud in New York City. Hip locals can now reap the benefits of the years he spent honing his craft in fine dining kitchens at this sharply designed and boisterous spot.The cuisine takes advantage of the best ingredients SoCal has to offer in highly shareable dishes featuring the bold, sunny flavors of the Mediterranean. Vegetables and seafood steal the show, with spice as a key supporting character. Behold the  kampachi crudo with an herb-y Israeli hot sauce and black lime, or carrots with crunchy cashew dukkah and burnt orange habanero dressing. Save room for sweets like the warm chocolate chip tahini cookie.
"
774,"Look for the telltale sign of this taqueria—that smoky gray exterior with hot pink trim—and you’ll know you’ve arrived at a local hot spot. Another sign? The throngs of people queued up at the Tijuana-style counter service-only joint.It’s serious business inside, where there are different lines and windows depending on what you want, but those in the know make a beeline for the sweet and spicy adobado pork tacos. Feel your taste buds tingle as taqueros slice hunks of spicy meat from massive spit-roasted cones of crimson adobada. Then grab a tray and stacks of napkins, as food this good doesn't come without a mess. Unique cuts are on offer here, including tripe, pork cheek, tongue and brain. Mulas, vampiras and quesadillas round out the selection.
"
775,"Nolita Hall brings new meaning to “flights” of beer, as it is directly in the flight path of the San Diego International Airport. This amiable hot spot doesn’t waste time with superficial changes; instead, they play it up with a board announcing the origin city of all planes in flight. It’s just one sign that this destination, where TVs show sports and shuffleboards await competition, is all about having a good time.Wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas take center stage and are the perfect chaser to the 20-something, mostly local beers on tap. The Y Tu Brute salad is a delicious take on the Caesar, while charred sugar snap peas and baby carrots go to show that this kitchen is full of surprises. Just hold on tight to that brew when a Boeing rumbles overhead.
"
776,"It’s in the heart of Little Italy, but you won’t hear any old crooners at this temple of Japanese haute cuisine. Instead, you'll find old-school rap on the soundtrack and graffiti art installations on the walls. And then there’s the bar, flanked by two faux-cherry trees in full bloom.The fresh-spirited menu brims with shareable plates such as blistered shishito peppers and crispy chicken karaage. Entrées include duck breast with golden tomato confit, miso-glazed black cod or even Wagyu grilled tableside on a yakitori. The sashimi is straight-up sublime, but it’s the envelope-pushing items that make the most impact. Contemporary maki, including the 30th &amp; University roll with minced crab, scallops and seared Wagyu, are a hit among the hungry hordes.
"
777,"If Frank Sinatra broke bread with Tupac, they’d probably meet at Born &amp; Raised. No expense was spared making this wildly polished, upscale steakhouse that resembles a mid-century, art deco dream lined with black-and-white photos of old-school rap legends, like Eazy-E. There is a glassed-in meat cutting room in the back; and a lovely, open-air rooftop bar overlooking Little Italy.Waiters dressed in tuxedos and Converse shoes drift between tables, pushing nostalgic tableside carts where they whip up starters on the spot or pour a drink to order. Certainly, you’re here for the impeccably cooked steaks, but don’t miss the tartare, prepared tableside with quail egg, capers and cornichons (to name just a few embellishments) and served with herbed aïoli.
"
778,"It's strictly breakfast and brunch only at this Little Italy spot, which isn't however just for the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. The playful décor may look feminine with its plush booths, pink-and-green marble floors and a champagne vending machine, but look closer and you'll find a few skulls and dark touches. Inside, it's always jumping and there's a wait, so plan ahead.It's all about familiar-seeming favorites and of-the-moment meals—hello, avocado toast and shakshuka. Fluffy soufflé pancakes are worth waking up for, and fried rice with pork belly plus two eggs with runny yolks is a great riff on tradition. The dirty scallop slice is a thick rectangle of potatoes au gratin fried to golden, then doused in rich sausage gravy for next-level enjoyment. 
"
779,"Loud and proudly serving “all day chicken and eggs,” this shack indeed lives up to its name. The dining area is almost entirely outside, so the planes flying overhead can’t be ignored and neither can the enthusiastic crowds, who seem to compete with that level of noise.Many come here for the fried chicken, but chicken sandwiches on bakery-fresh brioche, potato rolls or English muffins are heartwarmingly delicious. Pickled-brined and deep-fried chicken oysters (tender knobs of meat from the back) are the essence of what every nugget dreams of becoming. Simple but tasty homemade desserts like cookies and soft-serve ice cream complete the scene. Beer and bocce—beneath the watchful gaze of a larger-than-life rooster—is almost as much fun as the food.
"
780,"Hip, laid-back and a model of design, this indoor-outdoor space is at once many things. Inside, relax with a creative cocktail and bowl of lemon-Dijon popcorn while contemplating the entryway’s reflective blue-glass ceiling, the two-way fireplace and that nest of driftwood hanging from an upper floor. If in the mood for a clubbier scene, head to the rooftop cabana, complete with wet bars, TVs and self-service beer taps—just remember to reserve well in advance.The menu presents dishes from around the globe, such as “ribbons” of bigeye tuna tangled with sliced avocado and much more in a flavorful makrut lime- and soy-marinade. Of course, those plump and tender duck meatballs are an instant classic, set over cheesy grits and smothered in tomato sauce.
"
781,"Few locations are more dedicated to their theme than this seafood-centric restaurant, with its garage doors thrown open to welcome a salty breeze. The building itself is a gussied-up warehouse topped with the quote, “A rising tide lifts all boats.” Inside, the maritime-themed décor unveils brass portholes, octopus-like sconces and anchor-shaped bar hooks for purses.The cooking is just as true to the seas and their fishermen, who are specifically named on the menu. Diners may start with rock fish ceviche with citrus, coconut milk, turmeric and a hint of habanero—it's just right for scooping up with house-made sweet potato chips. The thresher shark lunch plate is wonderfully mild, topped with a dollop of puttanesca relish and creamy slaw.
"
782,"Set within a 1920s warehouse, this fire-hot spot from celebrity chef Richard Blais boasts of rustic charm (imagine redwood beams and tan leather furnishings).The menu also leaves no stone unturned in its quest for kooky inspiration. Fig tart, with a wedge of fresh fig tucked inside a tart shell filled with whipped hazelnut butter, delivers that sweet and savory yin and yang. A summertime staple—freshly caught prawns with Old Bay butter—is turned on its head, literally, as they're served head on and split down the middle. And that familiar duo of lamb with mint may be nothing new, but here the loin is served over beet hummus and enhanced by caramelized yogurt sauce, beet falafel as well as mint. An upmarket riff on a Yodel makes a charming finale.  
"
783,"It’s relatively new to restaurant-rich Little Italy, but this establishment has gained a loyal following since opening in 2016. The multi-level former warehouse could lean cavernous but its barrel-vaulted ceilings and funky artwork exude a distinct Parisian bohemian warmth. The whole place is set aglow and everyone, including the staff, wants to be here.Its wide-ranging menu runs the gamut—from rustic, wood-fired dishes including grilled trumpet mushrooms and pizzas, to more refined plates like venison over buttermilk polenta. The PB&amp;C, a chocolate-whiskey cake with peanut butter mousse and rich milk chocolate gelato, absolutely hits the spot.If on the run, head to their connected all-day eatery—a good bet for lunch and Wednesday trivia nights.
"
784,"Channel your best Ernest Hemingway before entering this place, designed to the hilt and a feast for the eyes with its library-meets-hunting lodge look. From its mounted trophies to the taxidermy specimens on loan from the Natural History Museum, this may not be the wisest pick for your PETA-supporting pal, but it definitely appeals to the trendy set.The kitchen perfects contemporary comfort food and wood-fired dishes are a big deal. Flames work their magic on grilled oysters, smoked Duroc pork tenderloin with red mole as well as boar sausage with gnocchi. Even Brussels sprouts are amped up with thick chunks of rich pork belly. Finally, get a spoon for the cornbread, which is best eaten from its skillet with a dollop of honey-thyme butter.
"
785,"It's smack dab in the heart of San Diego's power scene, located on the ground floor of the Pacific Gate by Bosa in the Embarcadero Marina, so it comes as no surprise that Animae is sexy and scene-y. This bastion of glamour attracts a who's who of trendy diners who come here largely to be seen—attention seekers should ask for the cushy round booths in the center of it all. Luxe details abound, with thick velvet curtains and art deco elegance, but the Asian fusion plates are on pace with the setting and most dishes are meant to be shared. The coal-fired octopus skewer with shishito peppers, basil aïoli and bacon is a reliable pick, while the chef's rendition of glazed black cod with tatsoi , sunflower dashi and shimeji mushrooms is a total crowd-pleaser. 
"
786,"Located off the beaten path and in a modest strip mall, this mini sushi counter has been a mighty hit since throwing open its doors. Inside, servers move about with quiet efficiency as soft jazz plays in the background.Guests are in good hands here, where Chef/owner Takeaki Tadokoro along with young chef, Tatsuro Tsuchiya, take great pleasure in providing them with a delightful dining experience. Attention to detail is a hallmark, as sauces are homemade and the fish of the day rests within a wood box awaiting very special treatment. The omakase, complete with a changing selection of fish, is seemingly the most popular option. Whether it includes those creamy and meaty oysters from British Columbia or succulent scallops from Hokkaido, this kitchen team turns out only the most superior and subtly seasoned ingredients. To wit: a mix of sea urchin from California and Hokkaido topped with ikura hits all the right notes, thanks to its rich flavors; while golden eye snapper with a thin veil of kombu is a salty treasure. Bluefin tuna is yet another highlight, marinated with ponzu and enhanced by yuzu kosho. Walk-ins are welcome at lunch, but reservations are a must for dinner.
"
787,"Attention-grabbing views and attention-getting food go hand-in-hand at this modern Mexican eatery set on the tip of Harbor Island, which offers dramatic panoramas of downtown San Diego from across the water. The enormous patio, equipped with a sizable fire pit, is the best place to soak it all in, though the sleek, glassed-in dining room is an enjoyable second fiddle once the sun sets.Chef Deborah Scott nicely balances old-school and new-world takes on upscale Mexican fare. In the former, you’ll find delicious guacamole, made tableside; while in the latter, a smoked beet tartare tostada with king trumpet mushrooms and peanut salsa. Chicken enchiladas “divorciadas,” with a duo of sauces are a memorable indulgence, as are piping-hot churros for dessert. 
"
788,"The Marine Room lures a well-heeled crowd to its sleek environs. Set within a luxury beach resort in the exclusive La Jolla enclave, it feels every bit the posh club. It’s also a romantic spot to celebrate a special date, thanks to those dramatic sea views at sundown—when a spectrum of colors light up the sky. Land a table at high tide, when the waves come crashing against their westward-facing windows, for a truly enchanting experience.The suggestion of jackets for gentlemen isn’t the only nod to tradition; the kitchen trots out classics like surf and turf as well as a Caesar salad prepared guéridon style. Some items steer a bit too ambitious; while others, like the trio of lobster, ahi tuna and Kona kampachi, benefit from a deft hand.
"
789,"As if idyllic Coronado Island didn't have you at hello, Little Frenchie comes along to steal your heart. This quaint space grabs you from the very beginning as you catch sight of that counter displaying a tempting lineup of cheeses, freshly baked baguettes and silver buckets of wine. Red leather banquettes and black-and-white cityscapes—it's Paris transported to Southern California. The menu matches the mood, with its familiar favorites and tried-and-true classics such as Benedicts, crêpes, mussels and more. At night, the menu expands to include heartier entrées, and suggested wine pairings. French onion soup, that beautiful mess of a delight, is spot on and the fruit tart goes beyond basic, elevating a typically humble dessert.  
"
790,"If the historic “Hotel Del” is the jewel of Coronado Island, then snagging a seat on Serẽa’s sprawling patio is like nestling into said jewel box. Thanks to its stunning views of the hotel's landscaped grounds and the ocean beyond, this is one of the prettiest perches in all of California. Just be sure to snag a reservation, because you’ll have competition from plenty of wedding parties and conference-goers.Deep-pocketed pescatarians will be delighted by the freshness and sustainability of the fish on offer—from inviting platters of raw oysters and cracked Maine lobster to flash-fried red snapper from Baja, offered by the pound for sharing.

Find proof of this in their crave-worthy creations—ranging from antipasti and salads to pastas and pizzas. Opt for a tasting menu and you’ll select the number of courses (the kitchen determines the dishes you’ll sample). Everything is made in house and with great care taken over each composition. Venison carpaccio with balsamic vinegar and Grana Padano foam is perfecto, not unlike the pappardelle with an exemplary and rich crumbled pork sausage sugo.
"
792,"Colorful, festive and beachy, this is La Jolla cove’s beloved home for casual Mexican cooking. There may be other Puesto locations, but this one seems to outshine the pack. The cuisine here has a restrained heat that emphasizes the fresh, bright flavors of Mexico, beginning with the pure pleasure from thin, crisp chips and fire-roasted salsa. Come on Taco Tuesdays when prices are slashed to explore their array of tasty fillings, many of which show artisanal flair through market-sourced grilled fish, garlicky mushrooms or zucchini and cactus. The exhibition kitchen also cranks out snacks like mezcal-pickled watermelon alongside heartier plates of seafood and enchiladas.Arrive during happy hour to fully understand their mastery of the margarita.
"
793,"""Irasshaimase!"" is the greeting commonly heard upon entering this cozy little sushiya. You’ll want to plan ahead to snag one of the eight coveted seats at the pristine counter, but it’s well worth the forethought, as these friendly chefs take great pride in discussing the quality of their fish and the techniques used to prepare your meal. It’s also a front row seat to their admirable knife skills.Such affability extends to the dining room, where servers flash big smiles and loads of greenery as well as natural wood come together to create a truly serene effect. Omakase is the way to go, but there are à la carte options as well—from appetizers, soups, sashimi and maki (sporting soft, well-seasoned rice) to specialty plates and daily fish specials.

A large, elegant terrace offers panoramic coastline views.Come early for their aperitivo (cocktails and snacks), but make sure you stay to explore this kitchen’s modern twists. Start with a daily salad special, featuring lovely flavors like beet chips and butternut squash, crowned by ahi tuna crudo with poppy seeds and basil leaves. Then dive into a Neapolitan-style pizza from the wood-burning oven, or decadent pastas such as orecchiette mingled with slow-braised duck ragù accented by tomato coulis, porcini mushrooms and freshly grated parmesan.

795,"There may be no better way to end a day of watching the seals and surf than tucking into a plate of Jamaican jerk pork belly at Nine-Ten. Located in the century-old Grande Colonial Hotel, this understated dining room, set with abstract glass art, and patio are more casual than grand, populated by folks who keep their shades on through dinner, of course. During lunch, the front sidewalk and back area overlooking the pool are divine.Many patrons put themselves at “the mercy of the chef,” which is their quirky way of offering a chef’s tasting. Others may explore the menu filled with seared halibut over summer vegetables with a saffron passionfruit sauce. The kitchen reaches its peak with desserts like honey-roasted apricot shortcake with pistachio crumble.
"
796,"Nestled within a restored mid-century warehouse in North Pacific Beach, The Fishery is exactly what it claims. As if you needed further proof, there’s even a premier seafood market housed at its center.You would be hard-pressed to find fish fresher than the selection offered here and the open kitchen does wonders with this market-driven menu overseen by these talented chefs, who let the quality product shine bright. Think—ahi tuna poke prepped with just a hint of soy sauce, sesame seeds and chili. Stuffed with crisp-fried cod fillets, rice, beans, guacamole and served with homemade chips, the cod burrito makes a hearty and hefty meal—just right for the many surfers who come here after tackling the waves at nearby Tourmaline Canyon Surfing Park.
"
797,"One of three locations, this family-run taqueria is inspired by the taco stands located just an hour away in Tijuana, but the name might as well refer to what you’ll be doing here. That’s right, you’ll be doing a lot of standing around, as the lines are long. Pack your patience and a watchful eye to ensure someone doesn’t snag your meal from the counter. The aggression is warranted, as the tacos, burritos and elote with mayo, parmesan and chili powder are all deliciously messy. The marinated pork in the al pastor taco is pure bliss; grilled mahi mahi is appetizing; and flame-grilled nopales are just right for vegetarians.The California burrito, bursting with fire-grilled Angus beef steak with cheese and French fries, is a thing of beauty.
"
798,"This south-of-the-border gem seems straight out of central casting for a classic surfer snack shack. The original member of the local chain that opened in 2011, it's laid-back, breezy, and set just blocks away from the beach, so you won’t need to brush the sand off your feet to eat here. That is if you can indeed find a perch at the counter, which has limited seating.Whether in or out, dine at all times on seafood-centric Mexican food, where tacos take center stage with familiar renditions—like crispy fish and shrimp, as well as more unusual selections including grilled octopus and adobo-marinated tuna. Feeling hungrier than usual? Upgrade any taco to a burrito for an extra buck, or stop by mid-afternoon for happy hour and 99-cent treats.
"
799,"Step into this charming trattoria and you’ll instantly feel like part of the famiglia. A glass-walled pastificio provides a behind-the-scenes view of the production—from fusilli to tortelli, while a tableside tiramisu brings the show right to you.There's a warm, boisterous atmosphere here, accented by the hand-painted, mismatched pottery on each table, and a musical Italian lilt will make a glass of Valpolicella all the more enticing. Most of the menu is mix-and-match, with a selection of pasta shapes and sauces that can be paired to your liking (though the friendly servers may nudge you away from a bad combo). Those on a quest for indulgence should look no further than the truffled gnocchi with a cream sauce, served in its own copper pot. 
"
800,"Barbecue is a veritable religion in America, and chefs in this realm have a near cultish way of doing things. With that in mind, consider this SJC bijou, packed to the gills with focused diners and trays of smoky meat.Punctuality is of the essence as everyone is here, early and eager, for Chef/owner Daniel Castillo's food. His creations draw inspiration from central Texas, so when that sweet scent of California white oak gets going, find yourself transported on a riotous journey, starting with slices of glistening brisket—correctly charred and deliciously rich. Add on a side of chili with more brisket along with a cheddar-jalapeño biscuit and never look back again. Don't forget to save room for desserts like banana pudding or pineapple upside down cake.
,
"
801,"Within this banal strip of countless shops, look for the place with the line out front, before the door has even opened. Once inside, take a seat at one of the dozen places along the sushi bar, where the chef’s omakase is served at bargain prices. A handful of tables along the back welcome larger parties. Reservations are strongly recommended and the house policies are strict: call precisely one week in advance, places are held for 15 minutes and meals will last no more than two hours.The freshness and superb quality of the rice and fish, from soy-glazed amberjack to scallops with grated yuzu, make all of this worth it. The omakase is only sushi, but cooked specials include salmon quiche, fried chicken cartilage and slow-cooked beef tongue.
"
802,"It’s hard to order poorly at this delightful retreat, formerly called Luscious Dumplings. The menu is concise, with half of the items dedicated to the eponymous specialty. Indeed this narrow hot spot has been a city-wide favorite since it opened in 2001, and continues to draw lines so long that servers leave a sign-in sheet outside. The secret to their success? Discipline. While many spots make dumplings ahead of time and freeze them, this kitchen starts fresh every morning.It’s best to begin slow with a tray of boiled pork and celery jiaozi—the wrapping smooth to the touch and boasting just the right amount of bite. Anything pan-fried, though, is the main draw. From juicy pork to fresh chives, these little parcels of goodness have few equals.
"
803,"The team behind these stoves swimmingly brings the vibrant smoke- and spice-focused cuisine of the Yucatán Peninsula to life. Of course, that same region's rich and complex history simply means diners can expect nothing less than seriously intriguing cooking. Start off with a mezcal cocktail, customized with tamarind and mole bitters. Mexican wines by the glass are another welcome introduction. From there, spoon up every last drop of the charred habanero salsa that accompanies crisp corn empanadas filled with Oaxacan cheese and epazote. Sikil p’ak—a pumpkin seed dip—is a regional favorite; then turkey smothered in pungent recado rojo makes a heady delight. Cool off over a honey nut cafe, topped with jalapeño-spiked chantilly cream and a single hoja santa leaf.
"
804,"This stateside location of a popular Asian chain is in fact a sleek and lovely Sichuan destination that prides itself on classic techniques. While ingredients may be imported from near and far, some items are made in-house (including the cured pork belly). An upstairs area is dedicated to gaiwan-cha, a traditional tea brewing method with roots in the Ming Dynasty.Even those familiar with this region's spicy cuisine will find intriguing dishes to sample on the extensive menu. Think of Chengdu-style lettuce tossed in a vinegary dressing to pungent spicy chicken, gently poached in a broth and finished with a heavy dose of chilies and scallions. Don't miss the sliced sole fillet floating in a wonderfully tangy and sour broth of pickled chilies and greens.
"
805,"The cooks here understand the essence of regional Mexican cuisine, so trust in their skills and do not be disillusioned by the menu line that reads ""substitutions are graciously declined.” Many of these dishes offer a spin on traditional items, as in the citrus-tinged achiote pork that tops creamy black beans and puffed corn tortillas in panuchos de Yucatán. Tacos are a signature for good reason; and the Puebla with spicy sausage, carne asada, smoked applewood bacon, and morita salsa delivers just the right level of piquancy.This special haven also makes the most of its idyllic setting, amid a score of antique shops with an open front that spills onto the street. Thanks to backlit shelves lined with tequila bottles, the vibe inside is warm and inviting.
"
806,"If the word “burrito” conjures up images of hearty, newborn baby-sized bundles of deliciousness, this kitchen is here to alter your perception. Specializing in the slim, egg roll-shaped burritos of Mexico’s Zacatecas region, this down-home duo of spots is all about the holy trinity of tortilla, meat and salsa—no cheese, beans (except in the veggie option) and definitely no lettuce.But while these delicacies may not be “supersized,” they are indeed superb. La Palma’s single-minded focus on fillings presents some memorable bites, from tender, well-spiced beef birria to soul-satisfying carne deshebrada, studded with chunks of potato and green chile. You may want to pass on the fried flautas though—the magic is all in the soft handmade tortillas.
"
807,"Bigger is better in O.C., and even by the standards of the huge open-air shopping mall that surrounds it, this dim sum palace is quite simply massive. Decked out with tablecloths, traditional artwork and a plethora of chandeliers, it’s a cart-free favorite for luxurious daily lunches—perhaps with a bottle or two from the high-end wine cellar.Choosing the best items from the equally oversized menu can be tough. Plump, glistening dumplings in varieties like shrimp and chive or crispy seaweed are a must, and may be accompanied by the “golden scallion pie,” a sesame-studded bun stuffed with scallions and pork. If you’re still not sure what the fuss is about with congee, J. Zhou’s, packed with tender shrimp and flaky fish, will make you a convert.
"
808,"This beef-driven, South Asian gem makes a splash on this quiet stretch, teeming with Mex-American eateries and markets aplenty. Originally from Pakistan, Chef Imran Ali Mookhi displays a certain deftness with spices, flavors, and in his handling of red meat. Chicken and vegetarian items are on offer, but there's no denying that beef is king on this menu.The décor is bright, neat, and hip. A bar in the back pours craft mocktails that pair swimmingly with such memorable items as beef (sirloin) kebabs with mustard oil, yogurt, and garlic. Sides of gunpowder mashed potatoes, garlic chutney, or dal Bukhara score high on flavor and texture. Australian Wagyu and Tomahawk steak will thrill carnivores; while seasonal vegetables have locavores returning for more.
"
809,"Big, dark and macho, this handsome stallion is located next to The Saloon at the foot of the Extron office building, all of which share the same owner. There may not be many cowboys in these parts, but there are plenty of decorative elements and music they’d covet here.The menu is of course meat-centric, but also focuses on seasonal vegetables grown on their own farm. Here, a caprese salad is taken to creative peaks when their garden offers more than 90 heirloom varietals. Also sample crisp popovers served with sweet homemade tomato jam. The prime rib is ultra-tender with jus, horseradish sauce and a cast-iron skillet bubbling with cheese-topped scalloped potatoes. Top off the repast with such comforting desserts as a pecan tart with vanilla ice cream.
"
810,"This restaurant strives to be a culinary microcosm of the distinctive regions of Mexico. On the outside, it may seem like a plain-Jane sort of space, but in fact bustles with passersby, shoppers and residents from around the way. Inside, bursts of color from the artwork make everything seem beautiful, cool and welcoming.Serving a contemporary take on this nation's regional cuisine in Santa Ana is certainly no small feat, but this kitchen delivers wonderful flavors, compositions and quality through a range of dishes. Highlights include the sensational enchilada verde, combining perfectly stewed dark meat chicken bathed with a tangy tomatillo salsa verde and wrapped in blue corn tortillas. Save room for dessert to indulge in their coconut sorbet.
"
811,"This low-key downtown spot features two distinct dining areas: a light-filled bar and its wall lined with upscale spirits, as well as a more subdued dining room.Chef/owner Ross Pangilinan delights everyone with his surprising, subtle and often ingenious spin on Filipino fare. That means that every dish seems contemporary and true to its southern California location, but the kitchen always returns to hints and touches of the chef’s background. Sample adobo-style pork cheeks or tamarind-kissed soups. The tropical verrine—presenting a modern version of the traditional dessert halo halo—has mouthwatering layers of coconut panna cotta, tropical fruit and passion fruit gelée.The best way to appreciate this kitchen is through the luxe prix-fixe.
"
812,"Set just minutes from the Pacific Coast Highway, this Italian gem makes a delightful sight. Inside, the dining room oozes warmth, thanks to sleek banquettes, artwork-lined walls and an inviting bar—perfect for solo diners. It paints the very picture of Italian hospitality and that's even before you've had your first bite.Chef Erik De Marchi's menu has something for everyone. He takes a range of familiar dishes and enhances them with an authentic flair. Timballo di carciofi is firmly packed with thinly sliced artichokes coddled with fresh fava and fennel. Though it's hard to pick just one, pasta seems to be the natural choice; while osso buco is braised to perfection and set on a bed of saffron rice. Desserts too are a dream, as they're all made in house. 
"
813,"First things first: doors open at 11:30 A.M. here and close a few hours later. It’s so small a window you know they’ll pack the house. And indeed they do, with lines forming long before doors open at this popular Taiwanese restaurant.Once inside, things move fast. A concise menu hangs above the cash register, so take a look before taking a seat. Three surefire hits include the fiery beef noodle soup (one of the best renditions in town); the sesame dry noodles; and the beef tripe and pork shank. The food comes quickly—you won't need to ask for water and you'll have a pot of tea with a Styrofoam cup delivered promptly to your table. All said and done, you’ll be out in 20 minutes—but talking about your meal for weeks to come.
"
814,"This eatery is located in a quiet complex, just steps away from an office park-dense area of Irvine. The diminutive gray interior is accented with wood slats, a vertical garden and plate-glass windows that overlook the gathering crowds waiting for your seat.Everyone is here for the deliciously concise menu, offering rice bowls, and of course, their signature noodles. Those three types of ramen arrive in a choice of shoyu or vegan broth made with sesame and miso. Specialties include the tonkotsu, which showcases a bowl of wonderfully flavorful pork bone broth so rich that it seems almost milky, stocked with thin, flat noodles made by the chefs. This is finished with slabs of char siu and perhaps a dollop of zesty chili-garlic sauce.
,
"
815,"Good things come in threes, and this third outpost of the burgeoning chain is indeed very good. Corporate types from the nearby office parks flock here seeking serenity, and sushi, of course.Categorized by fish type, the menu makes it easy to pick and choose from the different families, but relinquish the reins and surrender to the omakase of sensational nigiri. The chefs treat you with great care and will advise when to dab soy sauce on their creations. Live abalone, trios of tuna, duos of salmon (one torched and the other garnished with kombu), seared shima aji and eel drizzled with unagi sauce plus sesame seeds—it’s all quite enticing. A5 Wagyu followed by a cup of clam miso soup is the last hurrah and delivers a satisfying finale.
"
816,"This highly regarded Cantonese restaurant could easily glide solely on its reputation, and yet, its devoted chefs bring the goods again and again. One of the first of its kind to offer dim sum à la carte, rather than by an actual cart, items arrive piping hot, fresh from the steamer. You really can’t go wrong here, as each is more inventive than the next, flaunting ace flavor and wondrous texture. Bigger plates are all the rage at night—including sweet and sour pork, which finds elevation in this trusty kitchen's hands.Anything with seafood is a sure bet, but don’t miss the preserved salty egg bun with molten yolk. Families can be seen digging into steamed rice noodle rolls studded with bitter melon, or fried durian pastries oozing with the warm fruit.
"
817,"Made in-house, noodles at this special spot arrive in all sorts of preparations, each more delicious than the next. Think dan dan, a springy mix of strands slicked with chili oil, ground pork, peanuts and bok choy; or fragrant, boldly seasoned soups like spicy beef noodle.Chili oil fans will want to order the Sichuan-style dumplings, packed with tiny bits of pork and sporting fiery little pools of red oil. Another highlight is the Sichuan classic, Chongqing chicken, featuring juicy little morsels of fried chicken tucked into a mound of dried red chilies. Fresh ripe cantaloupe arrives at the end of each meal and is the perfect way to cool down your taste buds.
"
818,"Courtesy of Chef Amar Santana, this cool and rustic tapas bar offers consistently pleasing food and an extensive list of sherries and Spanish wines amid a quirky setting (the banquettes are decorated with jokes). In addition to the beautiful bar area, guests can choose to sit in two outdoor areas or the main dining room with views into the semi-open kitchen.The lunchtime prix-fixe is a great deal, though it would mean skipping their wonderful array of tapas and paellas. Standouts include the bikini sandwich, layering cured Jamón Ibérico, Manchego cheese and a bit of truffle oil into pretty little piping-hot grilled sandwiches. Croquettas de pollo tucked with shredded white meat are perfectly seasoned and fried to a golden crisp.
"
819,"Set on the third floor of South Coast Plaza and nestled among fashionable neighbors (Louis Vuitton and Baccarat, anyone?), this steady operation is certainly able to hold its own. The space is small, elegant, and well-appointed, thanks to a central dining room decked out with curtain-draped windows, white beveled pillars, and a dramatic floral display.Add on a gleaming open kitchen, chef's counter, as well as a secluded patio—and you know you've struck gold. Spacious banquettes and tables are filled with well-heeled patrons and in-the-know locals. Everyone is here for Chef Tony Esnault's contemporary take on classic French cuisine, brought to you by professional servers who virtually glide around in measured movements.The menu highlights imaginative dishes that weave technique with ingenuity. For starters, crisp-skinned sea bream in a simple beurre blanc is matched with fennel done two ways—braised then seared,  as well as a bright ""kraut."" Close at the heels is an equally clever dessert, where a frosted meringue shell is cracked open to reveal a rhubarb sorbet with strawberry gelée.A word to the wise: the north parking garage is ideal, unless you'd prefer to indulge in some fine window shopping.
"
820,"Home to some of SoCal's chicest boutiques and luxury department stores, South Coast Plaza is a shopper's paradise—and set right within this glittering ground zero is AnQi. Naturally, this dining room is the perfect complement to its fashion-forward setting; an exclusive and sexy vibe simply adds to the lure. Yet, the space is as welcoming as it is elegant and ripe for people watching, so grab a seat off to the side if you'd like to slurp noodles in private. The menu features an array of classics ranging from An's famous roasted crab to more eclectic dishes, like truffle-kissed sashimi. Come during happy hour for the appropriately named Red Hour, or on GourMonday for food and drink surprises—and of course, to leave a little extra cash in your LV wallet.  
"
821,"Originally from Atina and boasting a lineage of chefs and farmers, Chef/co-owner Sandro Nardone brings his culinary pyrotechnics stateside to this good-looking operation. Sea-blue acrylic chairs and fresh greenery lend a lush feel, while dark wood tables and an open kitchen welcome diners inside.It is an idyllic setting for a gastronomic retreat; and the singular, contemporary cooking never disappoints. Kick off with pork‌ ‌belly‌ accompanied by Fresno‌ ‌chile‌ ‌agro‌dolce and almonds. Spaghetti with parsley and cherry tomatoes is a nice counterpoint to this explosion of fatty goodness. Perfectly cooked hanger steak is yet another highlight, offered with savory spinach purée and sweet peppers. An affogato seems a most natural and fitting way to call it a day.
"
822,"Look out for the trestle-like tunnel, covered in vines and CD's, to find this gem, burrowed inside the artsy LAB Anti-Mall. Then make your way into the rustic dining room, donning plenty of wood; low lighting by way of wrought-iron fixtures lend a sultry feel. A faux-second floor balcony with vibrant artwork and a set of heavy doors leading out onto a terrace paint the very picture of a hacienda. Make no mistake, this is upscale dining with a laid-back vibe. The taste of Habana, starring pork croquetas, chicken and vegetable empanadas, comes to life with banana-habanero ketchup; while El Churrasco unveils meltingly tender skirt steak with chimichurri and cotija. Añejo rum, caramelized sugar, and fresh strawberries come together in a strong caramel flan.
"
823,"Like so many sushi counters, this one too feels like a neighborhood secret, hidden in the back of a shopping mall with no large flashing sign to mark its entrance and overshadowed by far louder (read: busier) neighbors. And yet, this intimate gem is indeed worth seeking out, as the ten-seat counter offers the chance to enjoy a leisurely omakase under the impeccable guidance of Chef Atsushi Yokoyama.Moments of quiet are filled by watching this one-man show lend artistry to the meal without too much pomp or glory. Begin with an assortment of zensai, tailed by a piece of peak-season fish that's masterfully cut, modestly seasoned, and entirely pleasing. Cuttlefish dashi may come next, served in a delicate and frosted vessel decked out with house-cured salmon roe, petals of uni, and just a light touch of wasabi. Kegani, or hairy crab, is then harmoniously foiled by fleshy okra; just as hotaru-ika (firefly squid) is deliciously enhanced by hinoki mushrooms, a dab of miso-vinegar paste, and tomatoes so sweet and tart that you may just never want for dessert. But hang on, perhaps we spoke too soon. Rumor has it that the almond panna cotta with macerated strawberries has resulted in many a swoon.
"
824,"“We do not serve American-style rolls.” Just beyond the entrance, that’s what the sign says at Ikko, a library-quiet retreat that prides itself on sushi and a sort of freestyle Japanese cuisine.Despite the sense of hush, cave-like vibe, small size of its counter and smattering of tables, there is a surprising conviviality among the diners here as they nibble on an array of delicious options—ranging from multiple omakase menus to traditional à la carte. A board lists the dozen or so fish that have arrived as specials that day. Every item is sure to make the most of such immensely fresh seafood. Highlights include a slice of fatty otoro; red snapper topped with a tangle of sweet onions; chicken grunt hit with wasabi; and a perfect bite of firm hamachi.
"
825,"While San Gabriel Valley is certainly known as a mecca of first-rate Asian food, this address offers another delicious reason to venture east of Los Angeles. This landmark Mexican restaurant has packed them in since 1999, cranking out authentic, flavor-forward, elegant food to crowds that just can’t get enough. Inside the cozy dining space, you’ll find a hospitable chef and warm, welcoming service staff.You can’t go wrong on the menu, but heat-seekers should try the chef’s signature sautéed shrimp, a spicy, tail-on shrimp dish served with a chayote gratin and warm, fresh tortillas best dipped in creamy black beans. The tender Oaxacan mole chile relleno, featuring a knockout sweet-and-savory sauce complete with hints of chocolate, is a standout for good reason.
"
826,"This San Gabriel Valley spot is not of the salty old fisherman and oyster crackers ilk, but it's still a seafood fave, albeit one that imbues Chinese, Thai, Cambodian and Vietnamese flavors and cooking styles.Begin with a hot and sour soup before moving on to seafood-studded chewy rice noodles. Salt and pepper crab drowned with sliced chilies, chopped scallions and golden fried garlic is a delicious deep-fried mess, but don’t ignore the elephant—er, lobster—in the room, though. It’s why everyone is here. This Newport special is wok-fried and tossed with spicy jalapeño, green onions and clarified butter. The plucky creature, served at a minimum four pounds and dripping with juices, is an undertaking worth ruining your best shirt.
"
827,"Look for the off-center signature “M” to mark this spot. Here, Chefs/owners Florent and Amelia Marneau are back to delivering their signature French cuisine, with an eye on the contemporary palate of their southern Californian clientele. This is a stunning, elegant and sumptuous establishment that feels and tastes familiar yet original. The cooking follows suit from the glassed-in kitchen with soft globe lighting to the fire engine-red Berkel that's ready to slice their superb charcuterie.Fans of this kitchen may recognize some of its signature dishes, including Amelia’s chopped salad, featuring a touch of kale, julienned Little Gem, French feta, cucumber and celery. Luscious caviar with lacy crêpes, chives and sour cream is another menu standby.
"
828,"San Gabriel Valley lucked out as the first U.S. location for one of Tokyo’s most popular ramen joints dating back to 1995. There’s often a wait, but know that tables turn fast at this sleek restaurant, designed like a minimalist shoebox with concrete floors, high ceilings and largely blank walls.The menu is just as abbreviated, offering only a few starters like takoyaki and yuzu potato salad alongside a handful of ramen options. As quickly as the kitchen works, diners know to get started right away while the broth is still hot and billowing clouds of steam. Dipping ramen (tsukemen) is the restaurant’s claim to fame, but other bowls like hearty tonkotsu chock full of green onions, or spicy miso ramped up with habanero powder and chili oil, also delight.
"
829,"When it comes to regional Chinese food, most think of either the tongue-numbing sensations of Sichuan or the roaming dim sum carts and steamed seafood wonders of Canton. This makes Jiang Nan Spring and its Shanghainese focus an all the more valuable addition to the area.Sweet vinegars and fresh seafood figure prominently, most apparent in plates like tender chicken imbued with sweet wine sauce as well as an irresistible platter of tilapia fried in a tempura-like batter flavored with seaweed. Finding regional highlights can be tricky since the menu lists upwards of 150 dishes, but gracious servers are more than happy to assist. With hardwood floors and large white walls, the airy, sun-kissed space is a fitting setting for such elegant cuisine.
"
830,"Set inside The Langham Hotel, this dining room is a stunner thanks in large part to the work of bright spotlights, glass walls, plush chairs and banquettes, some of which overlook the lush grounds. Patrons may rest assured though that this isn’t your typical stuffy operation, as the servers are warm and affable and the soundtrack is complete with cool rock and roll beats.The kitchen knows its way around steakhouse classics, serving an array of favorites. Their beef may arrive fresh from Pennsylvania, Australia and even Japan. When it comes to sides, creamed spinach is a stunning effort thanks to a rich béchamel sauce infused with garlic. Non-steak offerings from the land and sea are also noteworthy—try the Dungeness crab cake loaded with meat. 
"
831,"The parking lot is likely full and you may have to wait for a seat, but this efficient Cantonese parlor is more than capable of handling its crowds, which haven’t let up since day one. Adding to the buzz of this bright dining room is a massive TV that runs down the length of the wall, as well as a host of keen-eyed servers roaming the restaurant floor.The absence of dim sum carts doesn’t always guarantee quality, but plates turned out of this kitchen are both small and large, freshly prepared and appropriately hot. Golden-brown skewers of sugarcane shrimp, plump orbs of pork siu mai, and fluffy steamed buns filled with chicken and dried scallops all delight. Best of all though may be the rice noodle rolls flecked with barbecue pork or shrimp.
"
832,"Maestro’s location amidst Old Town Pasadena’s national chains is a bit of a red herring as this upscale Mexican restaurant is anything but ordinary. Instead, discover a sexy, modern space with soft lighting and lofty ceilings (perfect for date night) along with an ambitious kitchen delivering ingredient-driven dishes.The chef plates with an artist’s eye, elevating even the most humble of items to a creative form—that  empanada filled with tender shrimp and octopus over house-made chorizo and locro-style beans with a serrano lime sauce, for one. Braised lamb shank with just a bit of heat is yet another standout, but save the best for last with a moist corn cake topped with sweet and salty caramel popcorn, huitlacoche ice cream and crème anglaise.
"
833,"This restaurant is a utility player offering everything from lunch specials to sushi, but the real star here is the outstanding shabu shabu—available only at the counter, where iron cauldrons bubble with a variety of exceptional broths. Each is accompanied by a bowl of accoutrements, including several types of greens, two kinds of noodles, rice and tofu.If soup isn’t right for the season, opt for the crave-worthy sushi. Sample rich bluefin nigiri gently glazed with ponzu, or the off-menu battera (pressed rice with pickled mackerel)—a house favorite. Service is swift, with food arriving quickly to the counter or well-spaced tables. For those in a rush however, adjacent and fast-casual The Delicatessen by Osawa is definitely worth a visit.
"
834,"This quaint French bistro feels right at home in downtown Pasadena. The cozy space draws in anybody walking by, thanks to vintage frames, sturdy Mahogany tables, and a coffered wood ceiling. Whereas many restaurants are content to merely look like a French bistro, in this one Chef Dean Yasharian has the chops to cook like one too.There is no need to reinvent the wheel and he knows it, carefully preparing such sleek, straight-shot Parisian classics as Burgundy snails glistening in herbed butter; silky-smooth pork pâté wrapped in pastry; and duck à l’orange with celery root purée. Dessert is essential:  the airy Gran Marnier soufflé with crème fraîche ice cream and indulgent apple tarte Tartin are exactly the kind of sweet comforts worth returning for.
"
835,"This original, chef-driven restaurant is truly something of note, set amidst quaint brick buildings near Old Pasadena. The design is simple: boxy with high ceilings, red brick and mason jars everywhere. Make reservations or go early, as Union’s devoted fans ensure the tables are full soon after opening.As a result of it being a local treasure, diners can expect top-notch ingredients handled with care—like a sweet, summery strawberry salad balanced by an intense and savory arugula pesto. Carb-loading has never been more gratifying, as the kitchen kneads, extrudes and slices its way to pasta excellence. Saffron linguine arrives coated with an enticing sauce of sundried tomatoes, breadcrumbs and anchovies for a brightly flavored and well-textured dish.
"
836,"In stark contrast to Old Pasadena’s commercialized shopping district sits this simple but alluring seafood bar. Inspired by New England cooking, diners can easily make a meal out of the raw menu alone, which features a roster of oysters, clams, lobster and shrimp. But cooked plates display just as much care and attention, as in the classic clam chowder or delicious market ceviche with ponzu vinaigrette. First-timers though will want to head straight for the rolls—large brioche buns from La Brea Bakery arrive toasted, buttered and filled with Maine lobster, Dungeness crab or smoked trout with lemon mayo.It’s all too easy to finish in an airy room decorated with white brick accents, vibrant blue tiles, and schools of decorative fish hanging on the walls.
"
837,"Packed to the gills since day one, hungry hordes flock to this sleek haunt for its wonderful, wood-fired cooking. The space is dominated by a dark wood bar, plush booths along the perimeter, and lofty windows. Certainly, while the setting is focused on wood-fired cooking, all eyes appear to be riveted on the plate.The menu pivots around grilled meats, but the bar pours such tantalizing cocktails that it would be a shame to not partake. Back to your meal, a fire-roasted tomato soup topped with chives and brûléed parmesan makes a fine start. Then indulge in such classic American grub as a BLT, starring maple-sweet bacon, tomato, and red oak Lettuce tucked between a semolina roll. A tall wedge of carrot cake is the very stuff of (sweet) dreams.
"
838,"Parkway Grill may be known to have ushered in the open kitchen and exposed brick phenomenon back in the 1980s; and while many of the servers have been here for decades as well, this Pasadena favorite never shows her age. In fact, it's always bustling with a convivial scene inside, but everyone stops in their tracks and heads swivel when that platter of whole fried ginger catfish makes its way through the dining room. This aromatic behemoth is definitely a trophy, but with its deliciously deep-fried crust and addictive yuzu-ponzu dipping sauce, it's by all means a golden one.Regulars know to save room at the end for the crème brûlée Napoleon. This dessert may look a touch throwback but lingers on your taste buds for weeks to come.

839,"Say hello to the coolest cat in Pasadena. This breezy, A-frame hangout exudes all the feels with serious beats bouncing off exposed brick that stretches from the cheese shop and bar up front, past the open kitchen, and down to the handsome patio out back. All day, guests lounge in the parlor nibbling on cheese and charcuterie. Come night, the kitchen grill roars with life. Cornbread eclair with chicken liver mousse is an easy decision, but choosing between the cavatelli with braised lamb and lamb fat gremolata or the half chicken with smoked jus is no small thing. The latter is brined, steamed, and charred over open flames until the skin is crisp as a chip.You probably won’t have room for dessert, but order the tres leches with corn pudding, anyway.
"
840,"Deep blue velvet booths, reclaimed wood flooring, and a moody bar. If this alluring retreat looks straight out of a Hollywood set, well, it should come as no surprise, since one of the partners is indeed a blockbuster film producer. It's not just all pizzaz though, with a talented kitchen team who turns out inventive vegetarian plates, pastas, local fish, poultry, and so much more. On any given night, the room is abuzz with patrons happily sipping on well-crafted cocktails, sharing a charcuterie board, or digging into Kentucky fried hen, roasted lamb ribs, and dirty pasta (think rigatoni with ground duck).Kasekrainer over parsnip- and pear-purée is a home run, as are desserts, like the apple and huckleberry handpie with spiced rum-crème anglaise.
"
841,"You wouldn’t expect to find such a homey respite in the center of downtown Alhambra, amid an outdoor shopping mecca with a bustling movie theater. And yet, nestled within is this tiny and focused kitchen named after an island situated between Indonesia and Singapore.Diners start with skewers of chicken satay blanketed in a dark peanut sauce, before taking comfort in a big bowl of oxtail curry soup or a tangle of Hakka and Indo-style noodles. But true to form, the best dish here is the smallest—namely, the roti prata, which is a wheat flour-based pancake griddled until puff pastry-like perfection and served with a subtly sweet and spicy curry. It’s the kind of dish you’ll want to begin and even seal a meal with.
"
842,"Boasting two locations now, this spot is housed in the Mall of Fortune, which seems to be a suitably lofty name for such a local yet ornate treasure. Expect to be greeted by a line out the door, but inside, find a giant chandelier and clipboard with several names ahead of the free space to jot down your own. Don’t worry—that line moves quickly and you’ll be slurping up glass noodles in no time.Go with a group and order a feast as the menu, replete with regional specials, has much more to offer than one or two can possibly explore. Fresh, clean flavors are at the forefront of grilled pork spring rolls full of herbs, vermicelli and fried garnishes for irresistible crunch. Unsurprisingly, the soft tofu with garlic and chives is a hearty, well-loved signature.
"
843,"Nestled within an upscale galleria called The OC Mix, this simply appointed but highly desirable gem boasts one of the country’s most refined expressions of Mexican cuisine. Brought to you by the intensely creative Chef Carlos Salgado, lunch here focuses on elevated tacos. But in truth, this kitchen shines brightest at dinner, with a prix-fixe menu that's inspired by Salgado’s heritage and bolstered by top-notch produce and techniques honed during his fine-dining days.Following suit, the clued-up staff excels in every way.Centered around a sleek open kitchen and counter, the cooking boasts a unique level of reverence towards traditional ingredients like masa—and plates rarely appear cluttered or overly complicated. This is food that’s easy to eat and easy to crave. Look forward to intricate dishes like sea scallops gratinados with Chihuahua cheese and squid ink breadcrumbs; or a tamal finished with a sauce of sweet corn, huitlacoche, and hoja santa. If mole is on the menu, you’ll know, as its tempting aroma floods the room. Most recently, strips of seared Aspen Ridge skirt steak set in a pool of peanut mole were accompanied by guacamole and pea tendrils for an utterly peerless effort.
"
844,"If you are no stranger to the slurp, then Pho 79 is likely already on your circuit. After all, this place is an institution. Opened in the early 80s, it's widely considered to ladle some of the best and most praiseworthy pho in southern California.The simple interior is enlivened by a bright yellow wall adorned with numerous accolades. It's spartan but clean, and you're here for the pho, not the fashion show. Place your name on the clipboard by the front door and expect a wait. Once seated, peruse the extensive menu, which runs the gamut from egg noodle soups and goi cuon, to appetizers and desserts along with many varieties of the eponymous dish. You'll never go wrong with oxtail—it's the most popular with good reason.  
"
845,"Few kitchens can prepare a noodle roll quite like this local Alhambra favorite. Rice wrappers filled with gently cooked lobster meat and finished with a subtly sweet soy sauce arrive on a platter set with the lobster shell itself for a presentation that draws attention from all corners. Indeed, this kitchen puts a fine edge on the area’s dim sum scene. There is not a single cart roaming this elegant dining room, which in turn is managed by a team of fast and friendly servers who will ensure that you never leave less than stuffed. Traditionalists will want to end with a rich egg tart, but for a more soothing finale, order the minced pork congee infused with soy, green onions and wonton chips.The restaurant also runs a second location in Pasadena.
"
846,"This longtime favorite may show a little age in its décor, but the food is as vibrant as ever thanks to the ministrations of an adept kitchen. Known for salads, sandwiches and strong vegetarian options like a gorgeous burnt carrot salad with avocado, this team can also turn out a top-notch burger—with lamb, feta, mint pesto and garlic aïoli. Other favorites include that old Raymond classic—tender chicken simmered in a curried chicken sauce and served with peanuts, raisins and coconut.This “something for everyone” philosophy extends to the clientele—you’re as likely to find millennials gossiping over cocktails at the 1886 Bar as you are boomers on date night, right by the crackling fireplace. Regulars know not to sleep on the easy-breezy lunch service.
"
847,"With an eye-catching red-and-black design as well as a tome-like menu packed with tempting photos, it’s clear that this operation commands your attention. It certainly succeeds in nabbing buzz, as it is a favorite of critics and foodies alike.Dishing out fiery cuisine true to its Sichuan province namesake, it’s difficult to find anything on the menu without the red chili symbol. This food is not intended for milquetoasts, so if you have a spice-loving pack of friends, round them up, as the sharing-minded food caters to groups. Sup on mapo tofu, cold noodles with garlic sauce or shrimp with a crispy rice crust before readying yourself for the tongue-numbing fish cooked with serrano chiles, cracked Sichuan peppercorns and a piquant chili oil.
"
848,"Aside from the framed samurai swords and black dragon painting, it’s clear that this minimally dressed sushiya subscribes to the whisper-don’t-scream school of thought. That spirit extends to the menu, where there is no sign of fusion. Surely that is why a largely Japanese clientele packs this place. Sushi is available à la carte, but the seasonal omakase features fish served in rapid-fire succession. Hirame, with a touch of freshly grated yuzu zest, is a delicious start. Then it’s grouper with pickled daikon, which may be tailed by velvety kanpachi or shima aji with a dab of minced ginger. Spice heads will devour the red snapper with stir-fried shishito peppers.In keeping with its no fuss-attitude, they don't take reservations, so be sure to plan ahead.
"
849,"Chef Susumu Ii is no stranger to the SoCal dining scene and his sushiya flaunts an equally fluent repertoire. The space is chic and well designed; and the kaiseki-style menu, complete with Japanese-imported fish and local ingredients, is a tribute to the seasons.These plates are meticulously prepared and enjoyably nuanced. The Bizen option may commence with the likes of tofu topped with Bafun uni and yuba, followed by a procession of cold summer bites, sashimi, and silky ankimo with nukazuke pickles. Peak-season belt fish may then be presented with yamaimo and a dashi-simmered tomato. Nigiri, like wild flounder, hagashi toro, and baby sea bream, are crafted with care; and desserts, like rum raisin ice cream, are a wonderful way to seal the second chapter.
,
"
850,"Paradise for diners seeking a culinary adventure, this dining room flaunts a pleasing aura. Service is prompt and tables turn quickly, so those in a rush should come at lunch. It's no wonder that crowds are the norm at peak hour, as meals have been known to render palates smitten, thanks to the likes of fiery oils, funky offal and numbing chilies. Yet there is restraint, with ingredients enhanced by a none-too-over smoky heat.From the menu's creative lingo to a host of familiar items, few will have tasted such bold and perfectly calibrated flavors. The “big mouth” ginger frog in a chili-soaked broth, for instance, is an extraordinary start; while mapo tofu, cold noodles and other myriad preparations go well beyond the usual renditions.
"
851,"Yet another in the wave of Mexican-American LA chefs transforming the cuisine, Thomas Ortega brings his fine-dining drill to bear on this vibrant offering in his native Cerritos. Here he fuses his specific style of the city’s Mexican cuisine, like handmade tortillas and spicy salsas, with an American twist. Look for that Coca-Cola glaze on his pork belly or the sprinkle of Doritos on chilaquiles, not to mention such luxurious accents as truffles.It’s hard to miss with any of Chef Ortega's tacos, which range from light and crisp beer-battered cod with smoky salsa de arbol to gloriously tender and charred al pastor. And that fried “calamari famoso,” bright and peppery with onions and cilantro? It’s the ideal partner for a spicy michelada.
"
852,"It would be easy for this culinary haven to rest on its (glittering waterfront) laurels alone, and yet it is so much more than just a pretty face, or view. The outdoor seating is just right and certainly a bonus, but if that's not enough, this Newport Beach kitchen doles out such dreamy dishes as the famous salad, featuring a wreath of assorted vegetables, served raw, roasted and pickled in a lemon dressing. Black fettuccine flecked with crabmeat, uni and sweet peas is swoon-worthy, just as the fluffy chocolate mousse topped with malted-chocolate spheres makes a divine finale. From sourcing and preparation to plating and service, it is clear that great care is taken at every turn here. Don't miss a glass of wine or beer from their wide-reaching lists. 
"
853,"With its elegant design and backdrop of the sparkling sea, this ""fabled"" spot doesn't have to try that hard to win fans. And yet, it never rests solely on its good looks. The room is packed with an unmistakable hum of happy diners diving into delicious pub grub. The comprehensive menu has it all and you'll want to order everything (go ahead). The Guinness brown bread is an absolute delight, especially paired with plump P.E.I. mussels bathed in a thyme butter so heady that you'll want to slurp up every drop. Not far behind, the cracked pepper bucatini—studded with clams and pancetta—is a glorious tangle of goodness.  But don't forget dessert since their options are well worth it. Imagine brioche bread pudding with blueberry compote and crème anglaise. 
"
854,"The name comes from the building’s former life as the Highland Park Post Office, but everything else here is Cal-Ital in spirit. The dining space is convivial and airy, with beamed ceilings and an open kitchen as its focal point. The vibe is as good for dates as it is for groups.Complimentary bread is rarely as satisfying as their focaccia, with its crispy, salty crust and soft interior. Begin with a sampling of small plates, like hamachi crudo topped with dollops of Meyer lemon relish. Then move on to freshly made pasta, like tender purses of cappellacci filled with sweet corn and dressed in a sauce of butter, mushrooms and thyme. While a meal could end there, you’d be remiss not to order the wood-grilled game or cedar-smoked ocean trout.
"
855,"Otoño offers one of the best “siesta hours” around. With excellent $3 tapas alongside a solid selection of Spanish beers and bargain-priced cocktails (artisanal gin and tonic, anyone?), you’ll want to snag a seat between 4:00-6.00 P.M. if you can. Pressed-tin panels, a colorful mural and exposed rafters give the space an eclectic vibe.Modern California touches influence the tapas turned out of this kitchen, while larger dishes like braised octopus, smoked chicken thighs and paella options offer heartier fare if you're game. Don't miss the boquerones y mantequilla-a delicious little plate of fresh anchovies paired with roasted radishes and a terrific tuna and anchovy goat butter. Crema Catalana with wine-soaked blackberries is a light, boozy delight.
"
856,"La Azteca is an easy restaurant to find. Just look for the line of people snaking out of its front door. This modest counter-service operation has been serving hefty burritos from East LA for many years now. What’s their secret? Flour tortillas are made in-house every day in full view of the dining room and boast a kind of richness and chew that others don’t. There are nearly 20 different burritos on offer, but everyone comes for the winning chile relleno. The tortilla is cooked on a griddle and then filled—not stuffed—with slivers of sweet poblano peppers and gooey cheese. There’s hot sauce if you want it (you do) and a to-go bag if you need it (you won’t).Tacos and quesadillas are also available but certainly not the main attraction.
"
857,"""Chifa"" is the term Peruvians use to refer to a “Chinese restaurant,"" and if the green velvet chairs as well as the zebra-print walls aren't clue enough, look to the team who isn't shy about anything.The succinct menu pulls from family recipes and childhood memories to pack in flavor at every turn. Start easy with Japanese sea bream soaking in an orange and lime sauce, before moving on to char siu, starring pork cheek finished on a wood-fire grill—it's the stuff of barbecue dreams. Your visit would be incomplete without the lomo saltado, featuring tender chunks of filet mignon and sauteed onions coated in an umami-rich gravy and served on a pile of French fries. If, by some off chance, you’re still hungry, finish with a black sesame-cheesecake tart.
"
858,"Across from beautiful Huntington Beach, find this not-so-secret speakeasy tucked inside its parent restaurant, Bluegold. But the difference is palpable—LSXO is a bit cooler, louder and has a more defined personality. A trio of house-made condiments tops each table, with umami-rich fish sauce in place of salt, spice-infused oil as your pepper and a bottle of hot sauce as your furnace. Experiment with all three on refreshing noodle dishes like banh tam bi twirled with shredded pork, pickled vegetables and coconut milk. Other tantalizing mains may reveal shaky shaky beef, drizzled with burnt-butter soy sauce and set over garlic-tomato fried rice.Getting a seat here can be tough, but good food makes this so much more than just a scene.
"
859,"Hanging on the wall of this stamp of an establishment is a T-shirt that reads, “Better than your grandmother’s mole.” If you aren’t Mexican, the slogan definitely holds true, but if you are it probably still holds true. After all, they don’t call Chef Rocio Camacho ""The Goddess of Mole"" for nothing. Her sauces are ace, served in a humble outpost.Diners are greeted with a basket of warm chips laced with a myriad of moles that range from sweet and spicy to smoky. Best of the lot though is the classic mole Oaxaqueño, a 32-ingredient symphony of flavors. Coming in at a close second is the black-as-night huitlacoche sauce composed with “Mexican truffle.” Poured over a square of seared mahi mahi, it would be as good even if served atop an old shoe.
"
860,"How many leafy greens and herbs can you name? At this minimally embellished Armenian bakery, watch as two seasoned chefs knead, roll out, and griddle a specialty flatbread stuffed with more than a dozen chopped varietals. It’s as if they’ve been doing this their entire lives, working with the likes of sorrel, spinach, scallions, and beet leaves to make a tight, forest-green lining that is at once sweet, sour, sharp, and refreshing.It’s easy enough to eat one for a snack and several for a meal. Conveniently, there’s no need to guess what else to order here: The namesake dish is the only thing on the menu, besides a tangy yogurt drink chock-full of dill and cucumber, okroshka, and a simple square of paklava made with flaky phyllo and ground nuts.
"
861,"Everything you really need to know about this notable steakhouse is foretold within minutes of your arrival, when those complimentary duck-fat fries are placed on your table. They are pretty much perfect and very welcoming. Spend as much time savoring them as the lengthy Bourbon and wine lists, which flaunt a deep knowledge of top producers in Spain, Napa and Burgundy—all available at reasonable prices.The most notable specialty may be the butter-poached steak, sporting a serious crust and cooked to order. However, the pot pie filled with two pounds of lobster meat in puff pastry ensures that flavors are thoroughly enjoyable. Sides are better than they need to be, so do not miss the black truffle mac and cheese or asparagus with preserved lemon gremolata.
"
862,"Set on a busy corner with an unassuming façade, this may be a humble storefront, but it’s all heart with an inimitable taste of home. The eldest in a small but growing group of locations, you’ll be summoned to the counter here for a Styrofoam plate—but the braised meat with vegetables and handmade tortillas that fill it are the ultimate trophy.This clean, airy and family-owned spot is open all day, so pop in when the mood strikes to sample their daily specials. Consult the chalkboards for the latest update, then snag a seat at one of the few tables with a view of the grill. Cochinita pibil, shredded pork with sweet achiote spice and creamy black beans, is the very picture of comfort, especially when bested by the warm and toasty tortillas.
"
863,"Sequestered inside a former warehouse on the industrial fringe of Chinatown, majordōmo's location may not be perfect, but inside, this place pulsates with energy, especially from the open kitchen. Reservations can be a challenge to land online, but gamblers can test their luck by trying for one of the few counter seats on a walk-in basis. Is it worth the hype? You know it. Its singular take on Asian cuisine delivers hit after hit. Chinese bing bread topped with duck liver mousse is a classic, or go for smoked roe and egg or spicy pulled lamb. Then, vegetable-inspired market dishes like raw sugar snaps with horseradish share equal time with staples like legendary crispy pork belly, mafaldine with crab and uni with broken tofu. 
"
864,"The success of this precious jewel, set within a red brick structure and among a score of shops, is no secret, as evidenced by the onslaught of people vying to get in. Nominally embellished with sleek ash wood furniture, servers here mill about the room with big smiles and quiet efficiency.The little bites and dishes that precede the nigiri can often feel like a second thought at most counters. Not so in this case, where Chef Morihiro Onodera's omakase yields an impressive amount of food. A perfect cube of house-made tofu with wasabi and soy tailed by abalone with aged yuzu pepper make for enticing openers. Close on the heels are such impeccably executed items as firefly squid with wakame seaweed and halibut sashimi with pink peppercorn. Minimally seasoned nigiri may unveil everything from clean, white hirame to appetizingly oily mackerel. Most of the products are sourced from Japan, but big eye tuna from Hawaii and uni from Santa Barbara make compelling appearances.Thought and effort go into how this meal ends. For dessert, behold peak-season fruit, vegan mochi, and a raindrop cake with brown sugar syrup—all capped off by a box of taiyaki to take home and enjoy the next morning.
,
"
865,"This breezy, classic bistro may just be your next choice neighborhood haunt. Nestled amid the shops in Chinatown, the window-flanked space offers a full bar and dining room along with an inviting foyer and terrace. Clean, white walls are richly adorned with artwork and rows of wine bottles. The bar is of course beloved by solo diners, while groups should go for a table by the windows. Then get nibbling on a variety of cheese and charcuterie, before savoring such piquant mains as bouillabaisse Marseillaise with seafood aplenty, tomato, garlic, and herbs. A hunk of sourdough is great for sopping up its fragrant broth. If that sounds heavenly, just wait for the decadent pot de crème.A brief wine list, dominated by French labels, amplifies the experience.  
"
866,"An LA original, this colorful room has been dispensing regional Mexican cooking for two decades. Along the way, Chef/owners Jaime Martin del Campo and Ramiro Arvizu have become culinary celebrities, earning slots on Telemundo and Univision. But the recipes they learned at the feet of their Jaliscan grandmothers endure, just like the classic mariachi tunes that play overhead.The kitchen turns out a host of complex and festive family dishes that are menu musts—like chicken enchiladas smothered in a trio of rich moles (including the famed 45-ingredient mole negro). Poached fish in chipotle crema is intense, yet delicate; while a stuffed poblano chile en nogada is a riot of flavor—spicy pepper, rich ground beef, pecan cream and tart pomegranate seeds.
"
867,"Come with a group and order with abandon. The food here is so good that it will be hard to hold back. This dining room manages to be both modest and ornate, filled with large round tables covered in purple linen, alongside walls of gold-framed photos and murals. The vibe is so open and friendly that you might see cheese plates being enthusiastically shared among neighboring diners.The cooking is as honest as the servers, who are happy to direct you on how to order best. Dolmeh and chicken kebabs with stewed sour cherries and an irresistible yogurt sauce are the kind of dishes one can imagine eating every day of the week. Fattoush made with crunchy vegetables, verdolagas and dressed in a lemony dressing sprinkled with sumac spells of garden goodness.
"
868,"This large ""enclosed"" restaurant is tucked inside the multi-use Hauser &amp; Wirth Arts Complex. If that doesn't clue you in on its creative bent, the very conceptual art and open-plan kitchen will surely do the trick. The dining room meanders between a marble bar donning silver bowls of fruit, edgy light fixtures, and whitewashed brick walls. The cooking is strong, focused, and Southern leaning. Inspired by deer camps from the local farming community, the venison burger sandwiched between brioche with pickled green tomato and fried leeks is top of the charts. Sprinkled with benne seeds, Gulf shrimp aguachile with cucumber and avocado is enriched by a ginger-lime dressing. Excellent desserts await, but for a simple finale go for one of the house-made sorbets.
"
869,"As cool and convivial as ever, this is the kind of place where both diners and staff seem perpetually at bliss. Inside, it all feels like a labor of love, thanks to the husband-and-wife team who make it their mission to bring fresh, rib-sticking food to this neighborhood. The space itself is warehouse-sized and rustic, with a copper bar, tulip-shaped pendant lights, booths that appear virtually suspended, and a flaming red-domed oven.However, it is the cooking that lures these crowds. To wit: a justifiably popular deboned and properly grilled whole fish stuffed with pea tendrils, fried herbs, and charred citrus. Desserts though are equally enticing, so save room for a rich and creamy chocolate budina tucked into a crisp tart with salted caramel.
"
870,"Everyone wants a piece of this Middle Eastern spot, exuding all the downtown feels thanks to an open-air setting. A wall of dangling greenery greets you at the entrance, and a sense of bonhomie permeates the air. Bread, in all its wonderful variations, gets a starring role here—from fresh pita to savory black sesame and buckwheat loaves. Dinner standouts include succulent whole prawns, marinated with harissa and grilled to tenderness over a blazing flame, then paired with a creamy and cooling zucchini tzatziki. Slow-roasted lamb neck shawarma is equally divine and juicy with edges seared like a great steak.If you can exercise some restraint at dinner—and it certainly won’t be easy—save room for the delightfully rich and addictive house-made ice cream. 
"
871,"Marugame is a Japanese town where udon is loved and revered. In LA, it is a restaurant that refines the noodle to an art form. Here, diners are even privy to these large discs of dough being rolled out, stretched, and cut into deliciously chewy strands. The space is simple, clean, and welcoming, as evident by the groups of friends and families with tots in tow. Everyone appears to be on a mission—to indulge in these savory and slurp-worthy bowls. One fine example is the mushroom udon, which is infused with miso to create a creamy and umami-rich base. There are other items on offer, like the uni and miso ""carbonara,"" but with such wonderful hot and cold udon choices, bonus toppings, and cold Asahi on tap, the noodle clearly deserves to take home the trophy.
"
872,"First things first: Tsubaki is not a sushiya. Barring a lovely plate of sashimi (kanpachi), the menu at this delicious Japanese gem is comprised of classic izakaya food. Think fluffy whipped miso tofu, topped with marinated cherry tomatoes and pickled scallion kimchi; Salmon Creek Farm pork shumai with braised bacon dashi; and tender grilled chicken “oysters” kicked up with yuzu kosho. Dishes are meant to be shared and paired with beer or sake. Beverage lovers will thrill to the excellent selection of local craft and distilled sake—and they’ll also get to choose their own cups to enjoy these sips.Reservations and use of the restaurant’s valet are highly recommended, especially in the summer when nearby Dodger Stadium is stormed with traffic.
"
873,"This one-time taco truck is now comfortably ensconced in its brick-and-mortar structure in the burgeoning Arts District. Its original taquero may have moved on with talented Chef Jason Beberman filling in; but those long lines remain, thanks to the team's ability to develop their own expression of modern Mexican cuisine. The sleek space has playful touches, like spray painted table numbers, that match the overall vibe.Almost everything on the menu is worthy—from fish tacos with chipotle créma to taquitos stuffed with all the fixings in a baked potato. For a more unusual bite, try the pan-fried potato taquitos with avocado, tomatillo salsa, cotija, and chives; tailed by scallop aguachile with strawberry-morrita oil and serrano.  
"
874,"There are Italian restaurants all over, and then there are restaurants that cook real Italian food. With a nod to the Brera district in Milan, which boasts a deep history of agriculture, art and fashion, this operation honors its namesake with an edgy space, warm décor, and cooking that's specific to the Lombardi and Veneto regions. A set of affable and informed servers merely add to the lure.Begin with rustic house breads accompanied by butter and anchovy or ricotta and bell peppers. Then launch into a fried donzelle with dry-cured lonzino, lardo, and salame Felino; or luscious octopus with a chickpea purée and 'Nduja. Save room though for the true star of the show—a remarkably authentic risotto Milanese, presented with flair and packed full of flavor.
"
875,"It is a sliver of a spot with space for only ten diners at the counter, but this Echo Park hit punches way above its weight. There is a cheerful orange façade with a takeout window and a picnic table shaded by umbrellas; inside, the narrow room features a white wall with slender wood slats and bare bulb fixtures. Konbi is the brainchild of Chefs Nick Montgomery and Akira Akuto, who present a unique menu of Japanese sandwiches, product-focused small plates and Proustian pastries. Tuck into the pork katsu sandwich, a panko-crusted pork filet dabbed with tonkatsu sauce, mustard, and set between slices of soft bread from local bakery—Bub and Grandma's Bread.At dessert, order a wedge of custard tart for its delightfully unexpected layer of date paste.
"
876,"This “factory” is actually sleek, with cement columns, a modern bar and wide-open garage doors that enhance its lofty feel. However, the heart and soul of its kitchen is dedicated to traditional Northern Italian cuisine. This should come as no surprise, as Angelo Auriana and Matteo Ferdinandi are turning heads with their quickly expanding empire. Devotion to regionally specific flavors is clear in every bite. Ravioli, made in house, tucked with seafood and tossed in an aromatic and savory sauce, is a winner, but don't skip the shatteringly crisp focaccina calda di Recco, filled with Crescenza cheese—it's sublime. Desserts, including the paciugo, are a strong finish.Wine lovers take note—come Mondays, when bottles are half price at lunch and dinner. 
"
877,"This airy stunner, which occupies a former church in the heart of Downtown, flaunts an impressive open ceiling allowing diners to stargaze—and that’s not even counting the occasional celebrity sighting. The boisterous atmosphere is beloved by the trendy patrons, who can be seen swapping small plates from perches at the two circular bars and eclectic sofa-stuffed lounge.On the global menu, creative dishes sit side-by-side with more traditional treats like John Dory in a leek fondue strewn with pan-seared gnocchi and mushrooms. Save room for clever desserts like yuzu custard with basil oil and cucumber sorbet, or opt for another cocktail from the extensive list.
"
878,"Come here, eat and decide for yourself what it means to be an Indian gastropub—know however that it will be a thoroughly delicious process. The skilled kitchen delivers each dish with flavor and fun through its use of authentic ingredients mingled with global inspiration. Find the clearest expression of Chef Pawan Mahendro's philosophy in the poutine, accompanied by masala-spiced potatoes with the perfect dab of gravy, mozzarella and chicken tikka. Some mains may feature a simpler pairing of appetizing flavors, like fried fish served with chutney. Other menu options just rely on standard favorites, like Southern fried chicken—traditional in look only but a head-spinner in flavors.The bi-level dining room and tiny kitchen are as colorful as the cuisine.
"
879,"Straddling an entire corner and tucked along the edge of downtown LA, this airy spot woos with an open kitchen and industrial look combining exposed ducts, brick walls and glass-block windows.Over in the kitchen, the menu goes on to please palates with favorites like chunky guacamole. Tostaditas de ceviche have just the right amount of crunch, heaped with citrus-marinated whitefish, diced cucumber, mango, avocado and slivered fresh chili for a zesty one-two punch. Enchiladas de mole arrive with generous chunks of roasted chicken and enveloped in a dark brown mole poblano that is sweet with ripe plantain and balanced by bitter chocolate and myriad other ingredients. Silky-smooth flan ends things nicely, especially with a shot of custard-rich rompope.
"
880,"Set amidst fashionable shops and eateries in a hipster neighborhood, this Italian-influenced restaurant's modern house with a much-talked-about terrace doubles as a headquarters for area denizens. The young, stylish staff is highly dedicated to delivering a pleasant experience without putting on any airs.The menu is equally unpretentious, with a nice selection of not-so-small plates along with dishes designed for sharing. It's all about clean flavors and simple preparations here, with delicious braised lettuce bruschetta and smoked yellowtail collar. Pastas are rave-worthy; the salumi agnolotti dazzles with its smoky and salty flavors.Wines from small producers in France and Italy, as well as organic and biodynamic labels, show attention to detail.
"
881,"With its tall mirrors, tiled walls and tin ceilings, this rustic Italian eatery is every inch the classic trattoria. Hidden in plain sight just across from Grand Central Market, it is a known quantity with the local crowd, who fill these tables at all times of day. A few bites, and you'll be ready to pledge allegiance to the Republic, too.The array of excellent handmade pastas is seemingly endless, like long, tubular strands of bigoli della nonna, headlinng an impeccably balanced angus-and-sausage ragout. Then, try to pry yourself away from the noodle nexus and savory tomato-based sauces to savor freshly baked olive oil bread, deliciously paired with bites of polpettine di gamberi. Be sure to finish with a creamy affogato and be on your merry way.
"
882,"This is a sleek, stylish, and modern haven with an airy and fluid design. A counter and open kitchen reside if only to showcase the culinary pyrotechnics of Chef Josef Centeno; and the deeply robust prix-fixe flaunts all the fireworks—think peak-season ingredients infused with wide-ranging flavors.The mesmerizing kitchen (orange flames can be seen emanating from the wood-fired oven) places equal emphasis on both land and sea; while the menu is inspired by the culinary traditions of Japan and Italy. For starters, thin slices of geoduck are tossed with top-grade abalone, charred onion, nori oil, and citrus for a refreshing, flavor-brimming feast. Binchotan-grilled sea bream brings spring into focus with vegetables like locally farmed rapini and pea leaves. However, umami is the real taste of choice when it comes to plates like hand-torn pasta with porcini ""bolognese,"" lovage-dashi butter, and salted shiso, or the signature satsuki porridge with its moat of parmesan cream and rich Santa Barbara uni.The frangipane clafoutis with quince and Chantilly cream is a sweet send-off. Ardent oenophiles may then indulge in a sip from the organic and biodynamic wine list for absolute bliss.
"
883,"This entrance can be tricky to locate, set within the ever-evolving ROW DTLA, so look for the fluttering noren on the first-floor of building M2. An American white cedar counter dominates this softly toned space and ensures that dining here is an intimate and engaging experience with Chef Brandon Hayato Go.With only one seating per night, this is the kind of destination where a handful of lucky diners are privy to an exemplary culinary spectacle. Many of the courses begin with ingredients that are attractively arranged, then finished before your eyes, and presented by the chef with detailed explanations. The highest quality product is further elevated by such unimpeachable technique as the use of a binchotan grill. To kick off the kaiseki, the chef serves a small bite, or sakizuke, like chilled, charred eggplant with ginger and dashi to ward off the swelter of summer. From there, it's a seasonal celebration artistically arranged on pieces of vintage Japanese pottery and porcelain collected by the chef. Then local corn and sea scallops is transformed into kakiage; bonito is lightly smoked over rice bran straw; and miso-glazed black cod is folded into a luscious rice pot to conclude the meal.

884,"Courtesy of the same owners behind the posh Alimento, this is a neighborhood pizza joint done right. Familiar items aside, the kitchen boasts a clear eye toward quality ingredients and careful presentations. For instance, hand-breaded mozzarella sticks with chunky marinara bring out the kid in all of us, while pizza reigns supreme at lunch and dinner. The latter features such adult inflections as fiery chilies alongside more typical trappings like pineapple on the Hawaiian. The stepmother Italian sub is addictive and not unlike the salads, which are far from a tag-along, highlighting large portions with tasty blends.Desserts are somewhat limited but with a creatively rendered tiramisu and hefty wedge of cookies &amp; cream semifreddo pie, who’s complaining?
"
885,"This is a Jewish deli with an old soul. Inside, the décor is classic bubbe, arranged with floral wallpaper, wood floors and marble-topped tables. There’s even a vintage rotary phone mounted on the back wall that serves as a conversation piece or perhaps even a gentle reminder to call your mother already.You will not leave hungry here—even the small matzoh ball soup feeds two. The house-made Toronto-style bagels are terrific at any time of day, while the heartwarming Reuben surely ranks as one of the city’s top. Come dinner, start with a chopped liver spread with fried onions, trout roe popovers or potato latkes with sour cream. Then tuck into a comforting smoked fish platter or glazed brisket, which serves three or more at any given time.
"
886,"Keep an eye out for the neon pig above the door of this modern Filipino comfort food spot—think of it as a porcine portent of things to come. Inside, the vibe is family-friendly and casual, featuring a mix of aluminum and wooden tables set with bamboo and metal chairs. Order at the counter and take a number before grabbing a seat, that is if you can make a decision after reviewing the mouthwatering menu loaded with—you guessed it—pork. Adobo pork belly nigiri, a chorizo burger and a belly banh mi dabble with fusion, while dishes like lechon kawali stay in line with Filipino tradition. Come with a pal to tuck into the patita—a hefty pork shank braised, then deep fried and smothered with a chili- vinegar- and garlic-sauce for a bonanza of flavor. 
"
887,"Find this laid-back little café opposite the pedestrian plaza, Sunset Triangle. The dining room itself is triangular as well as hipster-friendly with a rustic blend of exposed brick, concrete floors and varnished wood tables.As casual as the vibe may seem, this is a serious kitchen dedicated to Asian cuisine. Be sure to try their vegetarian variations on classics such as pork-free mapo tofu, daikon dumplings and daily specials like the lotus root or seaweed salad. However, the cooking truly shines with Taiwanese specialties. The three-cup jidori chicken is its own simmering feast in a clay pot of dark meat with equal parts soy, sesame oil and rice wine reduced to a deep brown glaze, then studded with chopped green onion, dried chilies and whole garlic.
"
888,"Authenticity and tradition are paramount in this extraordinary little sushiya, which is sure to leave guests stunned from the start. Outside, there is nothing more than a modest beige-tiled façade with an enigmatic “Q” hanging above the door. Inside, vintage masks, pottery and lithographs bring a certain soul and spirit to the space.A comfortable banquette may be inviting for groups, but the best perches in the house are found at the counter. From the moment you walk in to the rapid succession of courses that follow, everything in this dining room seems steeped in a sense of calm. Meals typically begin with Chef Hiroyuki Naruke, who gracefully prepares every item and thoughtfully serves each diner virtually with his own hands. Edomae sushi arrives as an omakase of sublime fish, while other courses may commence with downright flawless sashimi and judiciously seasoned nigiri. Case in point—amberjack sashimi with onions and soy, where each morsel is sliced, seasoned and set before your eye. This may be tailed by such delicious nigiri as Hokkaido scallops, kohada and fatty tuna.The complete and immense pleasure of dining here extends right to the simple, spongy and fluffy block of tamago.
"
889,"There may be no more pleasurable place to learn about kappo-style cuisine, which has only recently made inroads into the American dining scene, than this stellar Japanese space, featuring a few tables and counter. The latter is crafted from a centuries-old cypress tree, set before chefs grating wasabi and a backdrop of amber-hued whisky. While the décor feels minimalist, surrounded by an industrial edge of soaring concrete ceilings and exposed pipes, service is wonderfully engaging and attentive, with thorough explanations of each unique course.À la carte is offered, but the multi-course kappo-style is the best way to experience this kitchen's creations. Dishes bring together a range of inspired Japanese flavors, but equal attention is given to texture and artistic presentations.Fixed menus here present a progression of courses selected by the chefs, which may include a few raw dishes. Highlights reveal an innovative ""true chicken teriyaki"" that has been dried and rehydrated to render enticingly chewy results. A bowl of California rice with favas, peas and shiso makes for a delicious prelude to Holstein steak topped with wasabi and diced pickled plum that's been aged for four years.
"
890,"Named for the historic 32-foot-tall “Commercial Exchange” sign that marks its exterior, this watering hole defined by geometrically set glass panes and set inside the hip Freehand Hotel is an oasis of contemporary Middle Eastern cooking. Its bright and comfortable dining room is quite the looker, bursting with lush greenery, while wood paneling lends the space a 70s vibe.Mirroring the striking setting, Chef/partner Alex Chang presents a splendid, wholesome and vibrant menu of this pan-regional cuisine. Opt for the salatim platter, a rotating trio of items like rich hummus with a dusting of piquant Syrian pepper; or shredded red cabbage with peanuts and dukkah. Simple desserts, including a warm dark chocolate chip cookie, are especially satisfying.
"
891,"This kitchen has been serving soul-satisfying food for well over a decade now. Indeed, it's a charming destination that feels like a warm hug with its feminine and welcoming vibe, courtesy of ebullient chef/owner, Natalia Pereira. Originally from Vianópolis, Brazil, it's clear that hospitality runs through her veins. The cozy dining room is lined with framed photographs and wine bottles set about the room are hung with handwritten stories for a special touch.The chef's careful and skilled hand is also evident in her food, which tastes of pure passion. Empadão de frango, a chicken pot-pie, is legendary (and can be ordered for catering). Some of the other popular plates include feijoada, galinhada, picanha, moqueca, and of course, those warming black beans.
"
892,"Sultry, colorful and complete with a breezy Caribbean vibe, folks flock here to tuck into satisfying food. While starters like whipped white beans with crispy pork, cotija and pickled pearl onions are captivating, delve deeper into such unlikely items as a Latin take on panzanella, featuring tomatoes and garlic confit. And while a dry-aged ribeye is hard to beat on its own, it’s especially good in build-your-own tacos with pickled sweet peppers and salsa verde.Dama's feisty flavors play well off its chic old-Havana-style dining room, with plush leather sofas, massive wicker fans spinning overhead and colorful tile underfoot. The jaunty front patio is filled with plenty of greenery, while the glam central bar busily blends tropical cocktails to order.
"
893,"This standout from Chef/owner Steve Samson is a favorite among local shoppers and visitors alike. While the area teems with restaurants aplenty, cutting-edge Rossoblu won't disappoint. There’s nothing avant-garde about its food however, and thankfully so. In fact, due to delicious summers spent in Emilia-Romagna, the chef's creations are a veritable ode to the region and promise to make Italian palates proud.Quality ingredients and simple execution come to life in the grilled pork meatball spiedini over shaved fennel; and roasted spot prawn with breadcrumbs and parsley. Pastas, like tagliolini tossed with ragù Bolognese and nutty parmesan are pure perfection. Close on the heels is an irresistible brick of tiramisu crowned with candied cocoa nib cream.
"
894,"In that eternal quest for that great neighborhood restaurant, Kismet fits the bill. Of course, that only works when your 'hood is Los Feliz and said restaurant sports a mélange of Middle Eastern influences. This kitchen offers all-day dining, but with the shakshuka, or poached eggs in tomato stew, this isn’t your pancake and French toast crowd.Dishes hail from Israel, Turkey, Iran and elsewhere and create harmonies that make the United Nations green with envy. From barbari bread to chicken and pine nut pies wrapped in flaky phyllo, you’ll be scraping your plate for crumbs. Freekeh fritters with “pickley green” sauce are like a carnival treat with an elevated international twist. Come hungry and armed with a crowd, since this food is best shared.
"
895,"Jessica Koslow’s tale began in 2011 with a line of seasonal homemade jams and an ever-growing fan base for her sweet and savory offerings. Just a year later, Sqirl was born—and the rest, as they say, is history. Today, hordes fill this tiny gem, and Koslow—a success story straight out of a Hollywood script—has a cookbook as well as an expansion in the works.Her no-frills café embodies southern California’s current food philosophy—healthy indulgence. Think grain bowls filled with globe-spanning ingredients, often topped with an impeccably sourced egg; or the chef’s signature ricotta toast, a buttery brioche sporting creamy ricotta and the jam that started it all. The latter is also available in such divine flavors as raspberry and Tahitian vanilla bean.
"
896,"There is no ocean in sight from this busy corner of East Hollywood, and yet, a single Santa Barbara spot prawn dressed with yuzu ponzu arrives so pristine and plump you'll wonder if it swam to your table when you weren’t looking. Then meaty, freshly harvested scallops from Maine are presented atop a tostada finished with yuzu kosho.Such is the beauty of this breezy hangout, which is so narrow that blink and you'll miss it. Minimally decorated with a long bar, wee kitchen and antiques, diners here can be sure of one thing—delicious success is easy to come by. This is in large part because the kitchen sources impeccably and prepares everything from sea urchin to razor clams so adeptly and simply, often with just a drizzle of olive oil or squeeze of lemon.
"
897,"Pico Blvd. is lined with Jewish delis, but stray from the pack and head to MacArthur Park and Langer’s, which has been ladling matzoh ball soup since 1947. And while it began life as a 12-seat counter, it has transformed to a massive space—decked out with booths and that classic counter.Equally ample is the menu, with all of the requisite standards, such as latkes, blintzes and chopped liver. Breakfast is served all day, but if you’re here for the first time, opt for the hot pastrami (provided by RC Provisions in Burbank) sandwich. Sugar-cured, seasoned and smoked; then piled with cheese, sauerkraut and grilled between two slices of rye—it’s the king of the castle. The only way to make this meal better is to end with a slice of sinfully rich cheesecake.
"
898,"Ignore the fact that Jitlada is located in a strip mall beneath a neon sign—the crowds prove that this skilled cadre of chefs knows what they’re doing in the kitchen. The setting even has a touch of Hollywood; next to their framed awards and reviews, find illustrations by the Simpsons creator (and Jitlada super-fan)—Matt Groening.The offerings are extensive, but certain dishes jump off the page. Be sure to sample bubbling-hot Taepo chicken curry, rich with coconut milk, brightly flavored with turmeric and tender morning glory stems. The range of “Spicy Thai Dipped Dishes” are equally delicious, particularly nam prik pla, vibrantly seasoned red snapper, ground with red chilies and served with the soothing tastes and textures of crunchy vegetables.
"
899,"If Korean isn’t in your linguistic arsenal, you’ll need to pack a fluent friend for your journey to this well-regarded strip-mall spot, where the menu and the welcome aren’t available in English. Don’t be daunted though, as the food is worth it, with authentic takes on everything from boiled game hen stuffed with sticky rice to the namesake cheonggukjang—a thick stew made with intensely pungent fermented soybeans that are this nation’s answer to Japanese natto.For those who aren’t ready to brave the beans, simpler dishes are still compelling, including a spicy seafood soup full of crab, shellfish and enoki mushrooms to a deep-fried whole fish. Of course, the banchan here is also a big draw, especially those spicy cucumbers or sweet, salty and dried anchovies.
"
900,"Chef Minh Phan's Phenakite takes up residence at a co-working office space called Second Home Hollywood, nestled among trees and within a beautifully maintained structure built by the pioneering architect, Paul R. Williams. Named after a rare crystal, this ambitious restaurant debuted in the midst a global health crisis and its—utterly romantic—setting reflects as much with dining being entirely outdoors—at curvaceous tables arranged under a blanket of garden lights.Chef Phan is a veritable firecracker, as she greets guests like long-lost friends and pours wine for anyone who looks thirsty. Sharing her undeniable enthusiasm, the staff—made up of chefs who serve the same dishes they’ve helped create—proudly present an array of Asian-inspired items. Subtle, elegant flavors and singular textures show up in spades in such deeply personal creations as mochi dumpling with lardon and sugar snap peas; or torched-eucalyptus and pink peppercorn leaves that create a cloud of smoke for seared swordfish.Save room for the best in show—abalone liver porridge, cooked in brown butter, and accompanied by more of the meaty mollusk. It is a masterclass in comfort and refinement.
"
901,"Soowon Galbi is situated right beside a laundromat, so this tidy little destination may not be a top pick among interior design divas. However, it is an authentic darling with two decades under its belt and always delivers when it comes to taste.Pancakes, steamed eggs and banchan start things off, but like all good Korean barbecue joints, it’s all about the charbroiled and gas-grilled meat. Soowon is a cattle town in South Korea, so know that the beef combo is an absolute winner, with a variety of cuts offering especially good value at lunch and hitting all the marks in terms of flavor and texture. Whether indulging in straightforward ribeye or garlicky soy-marinated galbi, each morsel is charred perfectly on the grill and will melt in your mouth.
"
902,"Specializing in the storied dishes that were once served to Korea’s royals, this mini Seoul-based chain stands out from the K-town crowd. This is largely thanks to its hanbok-attired servers and warren of private rooms, featuring an expansive foyer with a counter and carved wooden seats with plush cushions. Most diners arrive in large groups to sample set menus that are available at various price levels. However, dining à la carte is a great option as well.Those accustomed to the banchan will be astounded by the intricacy of bo ssam kimchi—a simple, warm and appetizing cabbage soup accompanied by a cold nest of pungent kimchi. This may be tailed by tang pyeong chae—savory mung bean jelly noodles tossed with sesame oil for a delicate palate-cleanser.
"
903,"Lauded as one of the city's most cherished destinations for Korean barbecue, Park's has been luring patrons for well over an age now. Its interior is simple and friendly servers warm up the vibe. Tables are equipped with grills, but you’re not required to work too hard, as waiters appear at just the right time to flip or slice the meat. Pork, chicken and shrimp are on offer, but prime beef, as seen in mouthwatering bulgogi, is your best bet. While their pricier American Wagyu is always worth the splurge, the acclaimed garlic-soy-brown sugar marinade is ace with short ribs. Still, you may want to avoid too much of a good thing by balancing it with cuts of non-marinated meat.Lunch specials are easier on the wallet, offer great variety and are very popular.
"
904,"LA's barbecue scene is forever brimming with options, so it can be hard to ferret out the more desirable spots. However, the lines wrapping around this upscale, long-standing gem are a sure sign you’ve chosen well. Its name reflects how the menu is organized—offering meats in quarter-pound portions, thereby allowing diners to sample an ample array of marinated cuts. Kick things off with the sizzling pork skin, loaded with rich collagen and excellent seasoning. Four strips of beautifully marbled boneless short rib are then presented on a platter, judiciously seasoned and cooked to pink perfection. This is a hip and happening space, so if you try sneaking in for lunch or early dinner on the outdoor patio, you may even succeed in skirting the crowds. 
"
905,"Find this tiny sparkler tucked inside the historic Hotel Normandie and helmed by Chef Gary Menes along with his talented team. The name, French for “counter,” is a literal description of the space, which seats no more than ten guests before the stainless-steel kitchen, and features little more than a wine alcove to adorn the room. Such intimate seating means that the ambience depends primarily on the patrons, who are either uniformly quiet and contemplative or lively and interactive.Dining here is a personal experience, emphasized by the fact that the chef is cooking and plating everything right before your eyes. Dishes turned out of this kitchen are innovative and handled with great care, with the chef focused almost entirely on vegetables—protein plays a subsidiary role. Keeping that in mind, anticipate the likes of a savory carrot velouté or morsel of cured squash, both of which are as monumental as the supplemental grass-fed beef. Much of the produce arrives fresh from the chef’s Long Beach garden.An amazing accompaniment to this meal is the skillet-toasted sourdough bread—it's made from a starter that may be older than some of the diners in the room.
"
906,"Named for a tropical island off the Yucatán Peninsula, this cheery walk-up stall shines bright with seafood, whether that's a whole grilled branzino, an exemplary Baja-style fried rockfish taco or an electrically spiced scallop aguachile. Run by the second generation of the Cetina family, it skews a bit younger than sibling Chichen Itza, with a sleek look, an open kitchen and a slightly higher (though still gentle) price point.Though it anchors the Mercado La Paloma, a market hall focused on affordability for first-time business owners, this stall does have a few splurges up its sleeve. The one worth splashing on is the addictive ceviche of spanking-fresh wild sheepshead fish, Santa Barbara sea urchin and pico de gallo on a crisp tostada.
"
907,"This colorful, welcoming spot is the ideal respite for simple Mexican fare, focusing on the small region of Nayarit, located between the forested mountains of the Sierra Madre and Pacific Ocean. The name also hints at their focus on straightforward seafood. The semi-enclosed dining room is well appointed and cheerful, with a clear eye on regional traditions.Ceviche de pescado is a zesty, textural feat, stocked with octopus and shrimp, set atop a tostada for delicious crunch. The caldo de siete mares is a deeply flavored and brothy feast of abalone, langoustine and much more. The number of signature items can seem overwhelming, but go with a group and be sure to get the molcajete al gusto and mi lindo Nayarit platter.Sundays may even bring live music.
"
908,"Chef Josiah Citrin's dining room at the über-cool Line Hotel in Koreatown has a distinct feel. Showcasing a pitched glass roof, thicket of plants and plush seating, this space boasts a conservatory feel, but it's unquestionably an urban jungle inside, thanks to a crowd of buzzy diners debating what to pick from the delightfully tempting menu.Two winning selections include a meaty duck ragout tagliatelle tossed with a dusting of pistachios and pecorino, and perfect Parker House rolls accompanied by an array of spreads, such as cashew-arugula pesto. A sumptuous stew of Caledonian shrimp and heirloom beans is an earthy delight—not unlike the dreamy brown butter-pear tart served with lemongrass ice cream.
"
909,"Owner Steve Massis along with Chef Cameron Slaugh are responsible for this craftsman-style ""house"" in bustling Long Beach. The bungalow façade gives way to a front porch and fittingly homey interior, featuring a collection of rooms. In the first, there's a brick fireplace and herringbone-style floors; another, set to the left, highlights floral wall paper and black-and-white tiles.These plates are gorgeous and decidedly Southern, but not without a twist or two, as in bubble and squeak or roasted cauliflower with cracked oats. Fried chicken and biscuits are at the heart of the carte, along with gumbo and fried green tomatoes. Peach salad is a de(light)ful way to start, especially if you plan to end over powdered sugar beignets with strawberry compote.  
"
910,"This distinct Oaxacan eatery knows exactly what its culinary mission is—so much so that it is made abundantly clear in everything from its website address (ilovemole.com) to the orange façade that announces its presence from blocks away. Inside, pops of green, vinyl-covered tables and happy faces brighten the whimsical setting. A grill station fills the room with the scent of blistering peppers and more.The tlayudas, enchiladas and pozole are all delightful, but it is their negro and rojo moles that are absolute favorites. Mole estofado is so complex that it is nearly impossible to pick out the ingredients creating such a rich and dark sauce, slathered onto chicken or pork. Everyone gets a taste of mole coloradito, drizzled over gratis chips.
"
911,"There are many Korean barbecue options in this section of town, so what sets this one apart, you might ask? It could be anything from the ample banchan and exceptional meats to the stunning setting and exemplary service team. Courtesy of brothers Andrew and Jaeyong Son, this cavernous spot is the talk of the town, thanks to lavish woodwork, sleek slate floors, and perfect ambient lighting.With a name that denotes the Korean word for ""butcher,"" it's no wonder they proffer only the most premium beef. While the tomahawk steak costs a pretty penny, it will feed an army with leftovers aplenty. Other items—like dry-aged prime rib or meaty short rib—arrive on a tray to be grilled tableside. Minimal embellishments, like soy and salt, ensure maximum enjoyment.
"
912,"Blending seamlessly into its surrounds, this modest storefront forms the very essence of neighborhood dining. Make your way inside to discover Chef Kevin Meehan's kitchen, whose credentials and locavore spirit are just as formidable as its eclectic wines and craft beers. The main room sports a restful, Scandinavian look that mixes caramel tones and leather banquettes with wood tables. Service has a fine-dining feel; and the mission of this kitchen is clear—wholly organic and sustainable cuisine.A meat refrigerator displaying dry-aged ducks, steaks and even a whole pig’s head is a natural conversation-starter and keeps all eyes on the food, which in turn lives up to its promise. Imagine a distinct spin on local flavors and of-the-moment techniques, like fermentation, preservation and deep charring to get a sense of what this place is about. Creativity also dominates each course, as seen in the barley risotto. Everything paired with the hanger steak, like buttermilk-garlic jus and porcini mushrooms with roasted potatoes, tastes like its perfect complement.When considering its ingredient quality and chef’s ability, it is quite apparent that a meal at Kali offers diners a stellar deal.
"
913,"Heave a sigh of relief, as this Long Beach babe is a long way off from the touristy hustle and bustle. Courtesy of a brother and sister duo, the white stucco building with a red-tiled roof dons a compact yet charming interior—think neutral palette, lofty windows, and dark green doors. A tall counter and open kitchen is action central, while a snug alcove keeps things very inviting.By day it's a sandwich shop, but fine dining is the norm come nightfall—with a menu of contemporary, seasonal dishes. Fruit may be a common theme in such complex items as roasted beets with strawberries and fennel. Aged duck is then mingled with pluot slices, parsnip-vanilla purée, and sautéed chard. Save room for the pavlova, turned on its head with sweet corn and blueberries.-
"
914,"It’s all about the duck—whole roasted in a clay pot—at this dining delight. And since the very best things take time, seat-of-the-pants types must know that this platter requires a bit of of planning; order at least a day in advance. However, upon entering this Koreatown gem, one may look forward to being rewarded with a generously portioned dish to dream about for weeks. Stuffed with chestnuts, sweet potatoes, rice and herbs, then wrapped and roasted for hours, the bronzed beauty is plated before your eyes. A spicy dipping sauce and light broth with greens simply elevates the preparation to epic heights.There's no better way to enjoy this festive feast than with a group, but walk-ins can savor the signature smoked treat as it's available at all hours.
"
915,"During the day, this enticingly arranged butcher shop sells humanely raised meats from local partner farms. By night, Gwen opens into a glowing dining room showcasing the same upscale cuts à la carte and on its multi-course tasting. Named for their beloved grandmother, this collaboration between Chef Curtis Stone and his brother, Luke, conjures art deco glamour by way of crystal chandeliers and a roaring fireplace.The kitchen yields Chef Stone’s own red-blooded show of culinary skill, with such decadent mains as fire-roasted pork or grilled boneless short rib. Non-meat eaters can take heart in a lovely ocean trout or saffron cavatelli with a hint of shaved bottarga. For dessert, the pavlova offers a fantastic nod to the chef’s Australian heritage.
"
916,"There are elements of reverence and seriousness to dining here, which is an asset for anyone seeking authentic Korean food. The warm servers all wear traditional garments to heighten the classic feel, while also donning earpieces in the upscale modern setting. The wait may seem long, but the food is worth it.The menu, too, can seem extensive with familiar classics from the barbecue lineup, but these are then elevated by the kitchen’s distinct care and skill. The sheer variety of banchan is a feat here. This is also the perfect place for large groups on the hunt for superbly tender meat to grill on the spot. Galbee junullk is a standout, presenting short ribs prepared with the house’s own “secret” soy sauce, then seared before your eyes with onions and mushrooms.
"
917,"In a sea of more-is-more Koreatown restaurants with massive menus, Master Ha stands out for its singular focus on a handful of dishes, namely marinated seafood and seolleongtang (or oxbone broth). Start with the remarkably fresh shrimp and crab, served plump and meaty after a light fermentation in miso. They're accompanied by an array of deliciously addictive banchan, including other more unusual kimchi like sesame-leaf.From there, it’s on to the soothing and restorative broth, which gets added heft from the addition of slippery, chewy noodles along with beautiful and tender slices of accompanying brisket. Ideal for a sick day (or a hangover), it is comfortingly bland—even though you can easily spice it up by plunking in some chili-infused daikon.
"
918,"If you crave authentic Southern Thai food, you’ll love this homey restaurant, which draws crowds to an otherwise unremarkable setting on Sunset. Chefs Noree Pla and Fern Kaewtathip spare no detail in rendering the cuisine of their native Phuket, concocting dishes rarely seen on American menus, including tai pla (a fish organ curry) or jungle curry with chicken feet.Even if you’re not ready for such adventurous food, there’s still a lot to enjoy here. Noodle soups are a specialty, with zeed (featuring a pho-like clear broth with three kinds of pork) being a standout. There’s also the Southern Thai fried chicken with sticky rice as well as a yellow fish curry. Cool down the spice with a homemade pudding in flavors like Thai tea, durian or Ovaltine.
"
919,"Little has changed at this longtime forefront of LA’s fine-dining scene, and that is a beautiful thing indeed. The dining room is as formal as the suited staff, who are well-orchestrated and on the cooler side of attentive. Even just watching each course as it leaves the kitchen, artistically presented on bespoke plates, is an absolute thrill.For his tasting menu, Chef Michael Cimarusti sources the freshest and most sustainable seafood, often wild-caught from American waters; and at no point during the meal will you ever doubt its quality. Indeed, purity and precision are the underpinnings of his California cooking, inspired by flavors and ideas from Asia and the Mediterranean. The sheer range of styles proves this kitchen’s versatility in using classic methods to pair seafood with rich sauces. The uni egg served in its shell with warm yolk and champagne beurre-blanc is a luscious signature. Other high points include canapés, like the nasturtium leaf taco filled with sushi rice, arare crackers and sea beans, or pickled sardine crostini with coriander blossom.Dessert is superb and ends meals on a striking note. To wit: chocolate-infused tea and a tray of delicate mignardises.  
"
920,"Though it’s popular with the locals, Soregashi also lures fans from far and wide, and for good reason. This little sushiya is serious-minded without being seriously pricey, offering a welcome middle ground between those cheap maki factories and high-end omakase counter destinations.The nigiri, from toro to tai (snapper), are of pristine quality; and the excellence of the fish belies its simplicity—even minced tuna with scallions or hamachi sashimi sing in the capable hands of these itamae. As if that isn’t enough, they also do an excellent job with izakaya standbys, from house-made cold soba noodles to crispy octopus. The stir-fried Japanese eggplant with miso paste is a melt-in-your-mouth delight, tailed by soft, silken tofu with dashi gelée.
"
921,"The vibe at this tiny haunt isn’t much to speak of—it doesn’t even have a liquor license. But if you take notice of the many framed reviews and accolades that serve as its sole décor, you’ll realize you’re in for a treat. Even amid tough Koreatown competition, Soban is known for its banchan. Featuring everything from traditional kimchi to sautéed eggplant, the selection is ever-changing and quite impressive.Most diners opt for the house signatures, including ganjang gejang (raw crab pickled with soy, garlic and ginger) or galbi jjim, a sweet and tender braised short rib stew. But the menu holds innumerable other delights, like nakji bokkeum, soft and chewy baby octopus stir-fried with chili, garlic, leeks and served with sticky brown rice.
"
922,"Open and operating non-stop from noon until late night, this bijou is the casual sibling of Trois Mec next door. The narrow room is always full and the counter cramped, as four chefs display their skills before you, assembling such lovely dishes as pâté de campagne. And while the setting may not sound overly comfortable, there is a focus on service, which makes every meal here a pleasant experience from start to finish.The French hip-hop in the background eschews tradition, but the cooking does the exact opposite. This menu is a canon of bistro favorites, like garlicky escargots in melting butter, steak au poivre and what may be the city’s best omelet. Save room to indulge in desserts like chocolate mousse or rice pudding with salted caramel sauce.

923,"A mega hit since opening over a decade ago, this Hollywood darling—sitting on a prominent corner of Melrose Avenue—continues to please with creative cocktails and delicious Italian cuisine. Its entrance is clearly marked outside the massive one-story building, though it is also home to Pizzeria Mozza, as well as a to-go option. The décor veers from typical osteria-style, thanks to handsome dark-wood paneling and a beautiful white marble counter. The front room is lively with music, while the back is quieter. A seat at the Mozza bar lets guests have a prime view of the antipasti being prepared.Chef Nancy Silverton's team strives to show you around the corners of Italian cooking, so dive right in to the calf’s brain ravioli with burro e limone. Bread is something of an obsession here—don’t be shocked to see hungry diners tucking a slice of multigrain or two into their purses.The crispy chicken leg is pure and simple comfort food; and pastas are unsurprisingly phenomenal—try the orecchiette with sausage and Swiss chard. Other highpoints include the mozzarella menu, which should be explored with gusto, as should the very smart wine list.Waits—for tables and again between courses—are to be expected.
"
924,"Mozza is at its essence a pizzeria, but so much more than a mere neighborhood haunt. Why, you might ask? It boasts the presence of Co-owner Nancy Silverton, whose culinary pedigree has foodies flocking to this Hollywood hottie. Adding to that, its sunny-yellow exterior and orange canopy set a Mediterranean scene.Make your way into this bright room donning bare wood tables and skylights. Pizzas are far above average, beginning with that unmistakable cornicione—perfect spots of char that rim the crust and bring the flavor. Toppings are just as fanciful, highlighting goat cheese, leeks and bacon; or maybe squash blossom with burrata. Come dessert, Pastry Chef Dahlia Narvaez works her magic with scrumptious treats, like Meyer lemon and kumquat crostata.
"
925,"The carnivorous heart of Nancy Silverton’s “Mozzaplex” is as intimate and engaging as it is expensive—a place to splurge on date night with a special vintage and view of the bustling wood-fired oven and grill. The result is a modern Italian take on the old-school steakhouse, with the focaccia di recco and bistecca alla Fiorentina being some of their key indulgences.Others may choose the charcuterie, from pork terrine to pancetta. Grilled lamb shoulder chop meets its match with oven-roasted cauliflower tossed in bagna cauda. If that’s insufficient absolution, the cocoa nib-caramel tart should send you over the top.
"
926,"Ceviche enthusiasts know that this petite, blue-walled restaurant is the place to go for the finest of raw fish. Though owners Carolina and Julio Orellana hail from Guatemala, their seafood-centric menu spans the map of Latin American flavors, with options ranging from shrimp sautéed in Caribbean-spiced coconut milk to fried Baja-style fish tacos, drizzled with spicy mayo.The number-one draw, though, remains ceviche, particularly the “bloody clams” version. This maroon-tinted preparation has won them a legion of loyal devotees. If they're all sold out, the shrimp and octopus ceviche tostada, zesty with lime juice and topped with ripe avocado, is a worthy substitute. Savvy diners must save room for Carolina’s expertly made tres leches cake.
"
927,"Aim for the two-story floral mural to find this Italian favorite with a dive bar-feel and plenty of LA style. Sit in the lovely patio, or head inside to the black marble bar. Other options include booths as well as an attractive communal table crafted from a varnished wood slab. Diners can expect to see pizza dough stretched, blenders whirring and the wood-fired oven crackling, all of which contribute to Ronan's swank allure.Cute and quirky food descriptions make perusing the menu as entertaining as it is appetizing. Many are here just for the hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza—its thin-crust enticingly blistered beneath minimal ingredients. But the rest of the menu is just as divine, especially such bites as blanched asparagus with Fresno chilies and lemon aïoli.
"
928,"Set slightly west of the Koreatown pack is a dining room that feels more polished and upscale than your typical Korean barbecue dining.Their high-quality meats are deftly handled by the staff, who intensely marinate them for searing on the grill and then slicing right before your eyes. Servers are attentive and tend to your cuts regularly, ensuring that each morsel has just the right crust. The “Combo A” is a veritable feast for two hungry people—this head-spinning array includes a spicy kimchi soup, thinly sliced bulgogi with all the fixings and perhaps the most succulent galbi in town. The parade of banchan; steamed vegetable- and pork-filled mandu; as well as japchae are equally impressive and must be sampled to truly grasp the skills of this kitchen.
"
929,"This family-style Mexican spot in Arlington Heights is known for its brilliant barbacoa, a signature of the owners’ based on an old family recipe. While a few varieties are offered here, the goat enchilada marinated with spicy guajillo chile and served falling off the bone is unmissable. This recipe passed down through generations of Chef Maria Ramos’ family is pure and delicious comfort.That's no knock on Ramos’ take on other specialties, including densely spiced moles, like the negro with pulled chicken in a tamal, or thin and crispy tlayudas topped with refried beans, quesillo and choice of meat. All of this pairs nicely with refreshing horchata with delightful additions of diced cantaloupe and cactus fruit sorbet.
"
930,"The delicious cooking at this humble osteria has been drawing crowds for more than two decades—and in a city that rolls out the red carpet for the hottest new thing, that’s no small feat. This simple, authentic charmer is the real deal, right down to the red scarf-bedecked chef in the kitchen as well as those regulars sipping and supping on Italian wines and fresh pasta in the dining room.Though the service brigade leans old school, their generous spirit defies the gruff stereotype. Menu favorites include expertly grilled calamari, linguini with sea urchin and a perfectly authentic tiramisu for dessert. On your way out, be sure to pop into the café next door for a jar or two of Chef Gino Angelini’s sauce and bring the goodness home.
"
931,"Republique welcomes guests to its warren of intimate dining areas with an abundant display of oysters, charcuterie and an ample bar. At the center and beneath a skylight, the fully open kitchen provides entertainment for a long communal table. Details are thoughtfully integrated—even the servers’ aprons match the indigo wall color.The cooking follows suit with a consistent show of talent, right from the first bite of their parmesan grissini. The menu goes on to explore the cuisine of Southern Europe through local Californian ingredients. Expect finely crafted cavatelli dressed in a simple springtime array of morels, trumpets and wild ramps; grilled octopus salad with Santa Barbara pistachios; or saffron mezze maniche with lamb ragout.
"
932,"This place is all about Tom Petty, Johnny Cash and gussied-up Tijuana street food. Pictures of those namesake artists, a colorful dining room and great playlist also make this a fun place to dig into contemporary Mexican fare, with an eye on the humble taco. Plus, the tequila and mezcal selections are second to none.The menu opens with shareable starters, like the gringa-style quesadilla with chili-rubbed smoked pork shoulder and jack cheese pressed between flour tortillas and drizzled with avocado crema. Don’t forget to try the Baja fish tacos, filled with Negra Modelo beer-battered rockfish, crema, cabbage and pico de gallo. Their tacos, folded with house-made blue corn tortillas, may be a few dollars extra but are absolutely worth it.
"
933,"This is the original spot that spawned a little chain of LA restaurants serving Japanese food with a spicy twist. It remains a treasure among the entertainment industry crowd looking to grab a quick bento box for lunch. The ambience is unpretentious, cooking is vibrant and the value for your money is excellent. However, be prepared for a wait at peak times.Start with the bigeye tuna sashimi, topped with spinach judiciously dressed in ponzu sauce. The chef’s special maki are a highlight, especially the very popular Robert Roll, combining spicy tuna, shrimp and sweet crabmeat topped with slices of spicy mayo-seasoned avocado, all wrapped up in soy paper. The shrimp tempura is particularly delicious, lightly crisp, yet still firm and tasty.
"
934,"There’s no shortage of good Thai food in LA, but this retreat separates itself from the rest with an easy-breezy vibe. Of course, the kitchen’s devotion to bright, fresh flavors and (when possible) locally sourced ingredients certainly helps it along.Dishes are cooked to order and your patience is duly rewarded. The genial staff takes evident pride in the food here, as they should—cooking techniques are exemplary and your best bet is to put yourself in the more-than-capable hands of the talented chef. Be sure to order the Crispy Creamy Lime Chicken to start, followed by the Truly Crispy Rice Salad. The latter is a mélange of fried curry rice balls, cilantro, ginger, chili flakes, peanuts and ground pork, served with romaine lettuce for wrapping.
"
935,"With its spare design, fire-glazed stone pottery and even Hello Kitty dolls doubling as décor, everything about Asanebo’s look is appealing. There is certainly no dearth of sushi restaurants in this city, but this well-regarded favorite has been at it for more than two decades. Three omakase options open the menu, which then expands to an impressive, if somewhat dizzying five pages filled with everything from maki, house signature dishes and an entire page dedicated to desserts. With so many decisions, it’s best to stick to the daily specials, though do keep a close watch on the prices, which climb slowly but steadily.While the items may pander a bit to the Western palate and aren't known for razzle-dazzle, they remain a standby for good reason.
"
936,"This may be the land of big, glitzy steakhouses, but Carlitos Gardel offers guests something more refined and quiet, with juicy meats and empanadas that have people coming back again and again. The evening mood here is romantic, and often accompanied by live piano music. There are larger seating options for groups, but those tiny, close-knit tables are often occupied by celebrities, without the paparazzi in tow.That said, big red wines, sharp knives and cutting boards laden with bone-in ribeye are sure to cover every available space. Start with a salad or crispy empanada with a side of chimichurri that’s so good it’s even available online for purchase. Sweet lovers rave about desserts, like a fluffy wedge of mascarpone tart with strawberry drizzle.
"
937,"It's set in the West Coast, but this new-school shack still has serious East Coast vibes—even if it does indeed source its sustainable, wild-caught seafood from both the Atlantic and Pacific. With an extensive raw bar, parking lot strewn with shells and a funky interior plastered with seafaring knickknacks, it’s a fitting tribute to Chef Michael Cimarusti’s New England origins.Chowder is a must for a seafood spot and this particular one offers a tempting flight of three: creamy New England, tomato-based Manhattan and buttery Rhode Island. The lobster roll, packed with tail and claw meat, is a gem among solo diners, while chilled seafood platters and the oak-grilled fish are great for crowds. Don’t forget to grab a bit of saltwater taffy on your way out.
"
938,"Those namesake chefs, Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo, bring serious talent and experience to this easygoing Italian-American café—they are in fact two of the Trois Mecs (with Ludo Lefebvre).The slender room features a branded display of pizza boxes, counter seating and a wide-open kitchen with views of the wood-fired grill and blazing oven. And those chewy, tender pies boast a blistered crust with creative toppings, like the Roman Gladiator heaped high with meat. Another treat is the Salad Days, tastefully decked with thick tomato sauce beneath bits of crunchy gem lettuce, sungold tomatoes and shaved caciocavallo in a garlic dressing. House-made pastas of all strands and shapes are equally tempting, especially when bathed in their six-hour Bolognese.
"
939,"Animal may not be the youngest kid on the block, having recently celebrated a decade in operation, but still it remains enviably cool and inviting. Its plain walls, wood furnishings and large windows read simple but defer to the good-looking crowd who frequents the place. This might have something to do with the owners—a duo of culinary geniuses—who are also the brains behind other LA hot spots, namely Trois Mec and Son of a Gun.Of course, the crowd might actually be here for the food, because it’s that good. As the name suggests, the menu focuses on meat and seafood, like rabbit larb and hamachi tostada. Inspiration comes from around the world, with cooking styles as diverse as Mexican, Chinese and even Indian, which makes an appearance in tandoori octopus.
"
940,"Norah boasts floor-to-ceiling windows and its gorgeous open and airy room is flooded with light. Handsome wood columns mix with sleek marble counters for a pale, ethereal setting that’s as pretty to look at as the food is delicious. Guests line the two-sided marble cocktail bar to enjoy hand-crafted cocktails from a carefully curated menu.Starters like the skillet cornbread with rosemary butter hint at the chef’s Southern culinary influences, but the carte spans the globe to include everything from cauliflower tartare with tahini and chickpeas, to jasmine rice congee or squid ink tagliolini. Lighter appetites may opt for the winter squash tempura with black garlic aïoli; while hearty appetites devour uni butter-poached shrimp with smoked tomato.
"
941,"An art deco relic of the Great Depression and hailed as Los Angeles’s first earthquake-proof structure—the Sunset Tower is a formidable home. Here, the maître‘d is known as a local gatekeeper of sorts, and alone decides whether you are seated at a mauve banquette by the terrace or in the more boisterous and desirable bar. Service can be hit or miss.Like the Hollywood legends that were rumored to stay upstairs, the menu offerings can seem old timey with deviled eggs and vegetables sticks. Yet they are prepared with skill and care, resulting in a perfectly juicy pork chop, well-seasoned and grilled until succulent, served with sautéed spinach and fingerling potatoes. Desserts are fun and may include a baked Alaska or make-your-own sundaes.
"
942,"Don’t dodge the valet or you’ll likely miss nabbing a table at this ever-packed place where Sunday brunch involves a perpetual wait-list. Mercado is loud and proud, so if you’re planning to whisper sweet nothings to your companion, those heartfelt words will go unheard.Margaritas and Mexican food go hand in hand, and the spicy cucumber margarita offered here is a sure thing. Opt for one of the many tequilas or mezcals for sipping while snacking, preferably on the dip duo of chunky guacamole and creamy choriqueso blended with spicy house chorizo, plus crispy and crunchy chips. This is not a street taco joint, so check the mirror for the specials, including a daily tamale. Top it off with Mercado’s flan, served with a brandy-spiked rompope.
"
943,"Sustainability is king at this polished farm-to-table spot at the 1 Hotel. With a 2,000-square-foot organic garden to call its own—and a personal beehive to pollinate it—this ""kitchen"" is seriously upping the zero waste game. Its airy, eco-friendly interior features olive trees and native flora set within reclaimed wood planters; and there are no disposable plastics or Styrofoam to speak of. Even the reception desk is carved from a felled Aleppo pine tree.The menu straddles the line between Italian and California cuisines, offering ample vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free choices. Starters like a creative turmeric ricotta and beet salad set the stage for hearty mains like a chicken Bolognese or savory lamb shank, featuring farro, stone fruit, and mint.
"
944,"""Tesse"" is French slang for charcuterie, and sure enough, you’ll find an impressive lineup of terrines, rillettes and artisanal sausages at this stylish restaurant. And though the cured meats program is integral to its spirit, this kitchen spins out an array of contemporary dishes as well, with careful attention to classical details and masterful flourishes.The chefs make daily treks to LA's various farmers’ markets for seasonal produce. Blue crab simplissime marries whipped potato and tarragon with reduced crab stock and Cognac; while bone marrow—roasted over the wood fire—is tossed with bucatini, duck prosciutto and shallots for a rich and delightfully balanced plate. The carefully procured wine list offers numerous bottles by the glass.
"
945,"The name is a necessary clue: look for two rickety wooden doors to enter. This is literally hidden-in-plain-sight, since all that signals its presence is a diminutive blue-and-white plaque emblazoned with the street number. Don’t be discouraged though, since it merely adds to the notion that you’ve stumbled upon a secret paradise. From the brick and cobblestone floors to deep blue walls and plentiful greenery, this ""Little Door"" gives the impression of dining outdoors. Of course, twinkling fairy lights and flickering candles make it impossibly romantic.Ample portions and modest plating seem slightly out of place amid the splendor, but good cooking leads to harmonious results—as seen in the sea bass. Be sure to share a tarte Tatin with your sweetheart.
"
946,"Its name is displayed in elegant gold script on the red brick corner building, instantly setting the stage for this self-described “modern chophouse.” The dining room seems timeless, outfitted in rich wood panels, thick white linens and dark spherical pendant lights for a flattering glow. Off to the side lies a comfortable bar and large semi-private table for groups.The enticing menu highlights ingredient-driven starters and meat-based entrées, as well as a lengthy list of daily specials. But, this cooking relishes global flavors and creativity, so expect such inspired items as char siu pork chop or lemongrass jidori chicken to be cited along classic broiled steaks or pot roast. Sides continue in the same vein, with creamed corn or duck fried rice.
"
947,"Once home to Hirozen, helmed for 15 years by Osaka chef Naruki Matsumoto, this bright little space is today his own sushi-ya, serving a straightforward selection of maki and nigiri crafted from fish sourced straight from Japan. No detail is overlooked by the kitchen—from the fine-grained rice that's judiciously seasoned and served at the ideal temperature, to the expertly sliced fish paired with it.Sushi is offered by the piece or as part of the omakase that lists each course with its respective price. Commence with a trio of red snapper, tender squid over shiso leaf and sliced sea scallop all sprinkled with lemon juice and sea salt. Grilled and fried appetizers round out this fine menu, but finish with a simple handroll of cool crabmeat.
"
948,"Sushi aficionados may have to look a little harder to discover this jewel box, hidden among a host of high-end boutiques. Sushi Ginza Onodera may have outposts around the world, but its fame has not diluted the exemplary quality of this cuisine. That said, it comes with a hefty price tag, though their strictly enforced no-tipping policy certainly helps. Notable attention is also given to the light-filled space, resplendent with Japanese elegance; and the knowledgeable staff is just as pleasing and impressive as the meal itself.Fish of this caliber is not easy to find and the kitchen gives each morsel the painstaking care it deserves. Surprises and delights abound in the delirious array of courses, starting with an earthenware cup of chawanmushi topped with Italian caviar and a petal of uni.  Some might feel guilty devouring squid in a matter of seconds after watching the exacting chefs take ten minutes to prepare it, but the experience is utterly memorable. The nigiri are a clear highlight here, revealing tiger shrimp with miso, sea perch seared for a hint of smoke as well as a duo of anago with shanso and yuzu zest.The signature matcha- and coconut-panna cotta is a delectable finale.
"
949,"There’s something utterly charming about Eveleigh. Nestled inside a rustic building that once stood on an orchard—yes, they paved paradise—this delightfully bright and airy restaurant flaunts an attractive and clean elegance. The light shines on this gem, but don’t worry since the open-air patio with a retractable roof is also equipped with heaters for those moments when the rays take a break.Sunset Boulevard may be lined with showy spots delivering lackluster performances, but this kitchen bucks that trend by subscribing to the notion that simple, honest cooking is best (think crushed peas and burrata or buttery pound cake topped with strawberries). Spaghettini twirled with tender and delicious chunks of Dungeness crab is a winner. 
"
950,"Located among a fashionable string of shops and restaurants, find this bohemian delight for seafood-focused Californian fare.Begin meals with a sample of wonderful small plates, like the shrimp toast sandwich with hoisin sauce, herbs and Sriracha mayo. Raw offerings are often prepared with innovative twists and unexpected pairings, such as hamachi carpaccio in a delicate galbi vinaigrette with Pink Lady apples, radish and microgreens. Also, be sure to sample the lobster roll, crusty yet buttery and generously laden with sweet meat bathed in celery-lemon aïoli; or the tuna melt, layering cheddar, tomato and crème fraîche over toasted rye. But the lunchtime favorite has nothing to do with the seas—their fried chicken sandwich is downright famous.
"
951,"Unless you’re already staying at the hotel, dinner here means driving along the lonely, hairpin-turning, and mountainous course of Highway 128 until you reach the quaint town of Boonville. But what a happy place it is, thanks to the talents of Chef Perry Hoffman, who prepares simple but arresting plates in a setting that is as comfortable as an old friend’s home. A recent menu showcased roasted sunchokes tossed with a rosemary vinaigrette; braised pork set in a pool of red floriani polenta made ultra-creamy with Pecorino Romano and parmesan; as well as a decadent chocolate brownie with cardamom ice cream.This is food that’s easy to eat—again and again. Opening hours change with the season and the menu daily, so check the website before making the drive.
"
952,"Whether it’s the ochre walls, the bold artwork or the fireplace, Terrapin Creek emits palpable warmth. Liya Lin and Andrew Truong, partners and co-chefs, have created an alluring sanctum where everyone feels like a regular, whether you’re a resident or simply here to spot the migrating whales.The menu is concise, so expect a spectrum of bites that may include grilled Monterey sardines set over shaved radishes and cabbage dressed in a refreshing lime-curry vinaigrette. Pasta is made in house, so dig your fork into those torch-shaped curls with crumbled merguez, chopped spinach, feta cheese, mint and sweet English peas in a spicy tomato-based broth. For dessert, a chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting is bested with a heavenly caramel sauce.
"
953,"You’ll be hard pressed to find more picturesque views than the ones at this charming, sun-lit nook perched right on the edge of Tomales Bay. Now under the ownership of Hog Island Oyster Co., the restaurant offers a casual but seriously delicious foray into ace seafood that's been caught or harvested in local waters. Freshly shucked Sweetwater oysters are a sensible starting place, before moving on to grilled ones smothered with a smoky-sweet barbecue sauce. Mussels steamed in white wine and garlic, as well as clam chowder are also worthy orders.Go for weekend lunch when the sun is out and the car ride sends you through rolling green hills and along the edge of the California coastline—complete with majestic views of the mighty Pacific.

Nearly half its menu features these ultra-fresh bivalves plucked straight from nearby Tomales Bay—whether raw, broiled with chili-garlic butter or simmered in a creamy leek stew. If oysters aren't your thing, there’s also plenty of other local seafood to choose from, including crisp-skinned steelhead trout or risotto with clams and uni. Carnivores can opt for a roasted pork chop with collard greens.Set in a country-style house, Saltwater is a small town hot spot that attracts casual couples of all ages for local beer and wine on tap.

Pizza is the focus, with ten varieties ranging from a classic Margherita to meaty staples like fennel sausage and mushroom. The deliciously crusty pies are named after local destinations, like the Limantour and Bodega, as well as the Farallon, with its slivers of roasted garlic, mini pepperoni with crisped edges and a pile of mozzarella.Given its cooking method, it’s no surprise that Cafe Reyes is stacked high with wood, both against the walls and under the counter. The big, spacious, barn-like dining room is rustic, unfussy and perfect for groups.
"
956,"Nestled in a quiet, woodsy corner of Sonoma County, this inn draws guests thanks to its dining room’s soothing colors, rustic-elegant décor, crackling fireplace and numerous intimate nooks, including an enclosed patio. The menu shows a clear focus on seasonality, with a penchant for all things Californian. Kanpachi, set against ripe avocado slices, crunchy watermelon radish and celery leaf in a bright, citrusy yuzu vinaigrette, makes a dazzling appearance; while perfectly medium-rare antelope tenderloin flaunts a luscious texture. The signature “rabbit, rabbit, rabbit” comprises a confit leg, an applewood-smoked bacon-wrapped loin, and a minuscule rack of rabbit chops.Pair your meal with a bottle from the impressive list of local and European wines.
"
957,"Is anyone surprised that the team behind Ramen Gaijin has another hit on their hands? The chefs here have traveled extensively throughout the Thai regions, which in turn inspired them to bring a taste of Chiang Mai to Sebastopol. For sure, anyone looking for the sweeter, Americanized side of Thai cooking is in for an awakening. This is food that is spiced and seasoned with little hesitation, and fresh and electric at the same time. The house-made Thai sausage, for instance, is superb—grilled and served with a fiery green chili dip. The paste for all the curries are also made in house, with our favorite being the green curry with Manila clams and potatoes.The space, too, is stunning, thanks to lofty ceilings, bamboo lanterns, and a tranquil pond.
"
958,"One of Half Moon Bay’s most popular restaurants, Pasta Moon is always packed to the gills with locals and tourists filling up on massive portions of hearty Italian-American fare.

Thin-crust pizza Margherita with its garlic-kissed tomato sauce is a delight, but oh that mascarpone cheese cake with a chocolate cookie crust. It's bound to send you over the moon. 
"
959,"“Gaijin” is the none-too-polite Japanese term for a foreigner, but the American chefs of this noodle joint clearly take pride in their outsider status, fusing local ingredients with traditional technique. It's surely one of the best bowls of ramen around, and you can smell the soup before you're even past the front door.The best seats are at the counter, where you can chat with the chef as he assembles bowls of light, fresh shoyu ramen filled with thick house-made rye noodles and caramelized pork belly chashu. Appetizers are also notable, like the karaage: crunchy-coated, tender chicken thighs with miso ranch.

"
960,"Located in the luxury boutique Hotel Les Mars, Chalkboard is a surprisingly laid-back boîte, with a casual vibe and a buzzing bar that offers a refreshing counterpoint to a day of wine tasting. The dining room’s low vaulted ceilings and marble tables might feel a touch austere if not for the rustic wooden chairs, open kitchen and warm, easygoing service. Sip a little wine as you nosh on sweet, tender pork belly biscuits in the cozy backyard.The menu of small plates spans every cuisine and appetite.

"
962,"Housed in the former Zin space, this contemporary darling is actually a full-circle comeback for Chef Dustin Valette and his brother/General Manager Aaron Garzini, whose grandfather owned the building in the 1940s. Its current look, however, is as cutting-edge as ever thanks to dandelion-like light fixtures, concrete walls and horseshoe-shaped banquettes. The bill of fare is modern American with a few French twists. Scallops arrive beneath squid ink puff pastry, into which a server pours caviar-flecked champagne-beurre blanc. Then, Peking-spiced duck breast set atop hearty forbidden rice is taken to the next level with a touch of tamarind sauce.For an appetizing end, dig into the smooth block of chocolate mousse with a luscious salted caramel center.
"
963,"Its home in downtown Geyserville has a Wild West appeal, and the interior, festooned with statues of saints, boar tusks and stacks of cookbooks, has a playful yet smart vibe. Diavola is certainly one of the most popular spots for miles—within minutes of opening, it's always a full house.The crowds are here for pizzas, like the signature combo of spicy meatballs, red peppers, provolone, pine nuts and raisins or the smoked pork belly, goat cheese and scallion, perhaps. Top-notch house ingredients include salumi, lardo and cured olives. But, that’s not to count out their pastas, including linguine tossed with baby octopus, bone marrow, zucchini and bottarga. Finish with their chocolate pistachio semifreddo paired with a Blue Bottle espresso.

The salvaged wood-dominated décor is perfectly cozy, and all-day hours ensure that crowds flock here for breakfast and Bloody Marys to start their day. A friendly staff, good, locally roasted coffee and a nicely stocked bar with a fine listing of beers on tap encourages further lingering.While snackers stop in for fresh-baked pastries, coffee cake or doughnuts, heartier appetites come at lunch for such warming items as a cast iron-grilled cheese with two-bean and parsnip soup. Dinner however brings more ambitious dishes, including a Berkshire pork chop, which when accompanied by a dandelion-salsa verde, forms the very essence of fresh and vibrant flavors.
"
965,"Set along a bustling stretch, Village Sake is a mighty hot and mod izakaya delivering authentic goods in the heart of quaint Fairfax. All the classic small plates are in full force here: crisp and creamy takoyaki (octopus croquettes), okonomiyaki, tataki (made with silky smoked hamachi) and coconut mochi cake complete with cardamom gelato.

"
966,"You’ll know there is indeed something special going on here when you see the number of regulars pack into the tiny, no-frills space, which claims a whopping four tables and small takeaway counter to its name. The owners are a father-daughter duo (Paul and Rebecca Yu) who originally had a larger space, but have since downsized into this warm little spot—and their loyal crowds don't seem to mind.Start with the pan-fried pork buns, a quintet of pillowy buns filled with delicious, juicy pork and seared to crisp, golden perfection. Vegetarian potstickers are equally divine, sporting a vibrant, tender stuffing of colorful vegetables and rice noodles as well as a crisp shell. Noodle fans take note—the broths are solid, but play second fiddle to the dumplings.
"
967,"The foggy beaches of Marin County may be a far cry from the sand and surf of Baja, but this lively spot keeps the vacation vibe alive with margaritas, mezcal and madly delicious Mexican cooking. And while Playa feels upmarket with its colorful tiles, blown-glass lights and walls of windows, its food is wonderfully authentic.The menu makes for tough choices: opt for the outstanding al pastor tacos layered with sweet-spicy caramelized pineapple salsa, or the crispy empanadas stuffed with chorizo, currants and green olives, drizzled with chimichurri. Whether you choose a cocktail and a mushroom-squash blossom quesadilla at the bar or bowls of chips and queso fundido with a big group on the sunny back patio, good times are guaranteed.

Standouts include sakura masu with a salt-cured cherry blossom leaf, buttery Hokkaido scallop and the signature ikura—cured in soy sauce, sake and honey, then finished with a grating of velvety frozen monkfish liver.Decadent supplements, like torched A5 Wagyu beef and luscious uni, can be added along the way. But the meal finishes with a surprisingly gentle send-off: sweet, tender mochi dabbed with adzuki bean paste.

1011,"This tiny, intensely personal restaurant from Chef/owner Melissa Perello has been a local hit from the get-go. Chic and always packed, it’s as perfect for a low-key date night as it is for dinner with the kids. And while reservations are nigh-impossible to score here, its astonishingly cozy setting attended to by a gracious staff justifies planning ahead.Perello eschews trendy powders and foams for hearty and seasonal fare like charred baby octopus with homemade yogurt and olive tapenade. Honey-brined pork chop rests over creamed escarole and fennel slaw; while McGinnis Ranch carrots are roasted with sunchokes for an interesting blend of sweet and savory. Desserts like a black sesame pavlova with chicory root ice cream offer a light, fresh conclusion.
"
1012,"Che fico (“what a fig”) is Italian slang for “How cool!” And the sharply dressed crowd at this good-looking spot is indeed very cool—but they give quite a fig about landing a highly coveted reservation. If you’re not a celebrity or tech mogul with an inside line, expect to wait in one. The balanced and beautiful array of cocktails, like a gently spicy banana milk punch, will help bide the time nicely.The vibe is chic, but this food is approachable with rotating pastas like the saffron spaghetti with 'nduja, quirky, compelling pizzas (try the pineapple, red onion and fermented chili number) and Roman-Jewish appetizers like the artistically plated grilled duck liver with matzo.Desserts are an absolute must: the coffee-blueberry pavlova may sound odd, but it’s divine.
"
1013,"Only the truly iron-willed will make it out of here without sampling at least one of the decadent, baklava-like treats on display in this sweet little space—and sample you should, as each oozes with delectable syrup and bright green pistachios shipped in from Turkey. A dessert from the case, paired with house Turkish tea, is the only reasonable way to finish a meal in this place. On the other hand, the best way to begin is with the terrific Baba sampler, chockablock with creamy hummus, silky baba ganoush, vibrant tabbouleh, tender dolma, eggplant salad, ezme and next-level falafel.The laid-back neighborhood vibe is bolstered by the friendly and welcoming staff inside, but with only 27 seats to its name, you’ll want to claim your spot early in the game.
"
1014,"“Good eats” are promised right in the name of this homey restaurant on the outskirts of the Mission, and La Cocina alum Isabel Caudillo delivers. Her menu centers on guisados, the luscious slow-cooked stews of her native Mexico City. Whether you opt for piquant meatballs in chipotle sauce or tender pork with green mole, you’ll receive plenty of warm, handmade corn tortillas to mop up every last drop of her delectable blends.The tightly edited menu is rounded out with other Mexican classics: tacos, tortas, chilaquiles and fresh-fried tortilla chips accompanied by a hefty scoop of tangy guacamole. Chase it down with an ice-cold Mexican Coca-Cola, but remember to save room for Caudillo’s creamy, caramelized flan—it’s one of the best renditions in the city.
"
1015,"Belinda Leong and Michel Suas have long been recognized as Bay Area pastry royalty, so naturally this foray into sit-down dining (located next door to their much-acclaimed B. Patisserie) is a treat. To sweeten the pot even further, they tapped JP Carmona, formerly chef de cuisine at Manresa, to lead the kitchen.The result is a welcoming neighborhood spot serving French bistro fare with a distinct Californian accent. A seemingly casual approach belies serious culinary sophistication in dishes like a hot-and-cold composition of crisp, buttery potato pavé topped with sweet Dungeness crab in an herby, lemony mayonnaise. In addition, fantastic seasonal produce and bold flavors are hallmarks year-round; so, it should go without saying, save room for dessert.
"
1016,"An undying favorite of yuppies, families and tourists alike, A16 is known for rustic Italian cooking and a vast selection of delicious, unusual wines from all over the boot. Dinner reservations are indispensable, especially if you want one of the prime counter seats facing the open kitchen and wood-burning pizza oven.The menu’s pies, pastas and antipasti change with the season, though the delicious maccaronara with ragu napoletana is a staple. Come summer, the zucca pizza is spot on with its wonderfully chewy and blistered crust topped with summer squash, fior di latte, and Grana Padano. And those scissors, just right for slicing it all up, make for a fun bonus. For dessert, look no further than the fig crostata with vanilla gelato.
"
1017,"Vegetables are the star of the menu at this bright blue oasis on busy Valencia Street, even though it adheres to a mostly pescatarian philosophy, with meat options also available on the side. Chef/owner Aaron London (a.k.a. AL) is wildly adept with the seasons’ bounty, making a dish of blistered squash with pickled kohlrabi, hummus and creamy burrata feel as complex and luxurious as the offerings at a steakhouse.London’s menu is chockablock with creativity, from the brine-pickled French fries and flavorful ras el hanout olives that kick off each meal, to the silky grits topped with tangy goat’s milk curds, Brussels sprouts, chanterelles and yuzu. At times, the combinations can read like a five-car pile-up—cured trout, mashed turnips and bagna cauda? But the crew always manages to smoothly navigate the layers of flavor, blazing new trails in diners’ imaginations.Like the menu, AL’s space is bright, open and cheerful, with plenty of natural light, bold colors and a casual but engaging staff. Embrace this energy, perhaps with a glass of French wine or a craft beer, and let the boisterous, creative spirit of the restaurant win you over.
"
1018,"One of the city of San Francisco's greats for rustic California-Italian meals, Delfina is nestled on a block of gems for food lovers, including Bi-Rite (and its creamery), Tartine Bakery and sister spot, Pizzeria Delfina. But even with this rarefied competition, Delfina continues to book well in advance and draws long lines for its few walk-in seats.The lively dining room is attended to by a warm cadre of servers, and the bill of fare shifts with the seasons. Soul-satisfying dishes might include doppio raviolo filled with ricotta di bufala and fava bean purée, roasted chicken with olive oil-mashed potatoes or wild king salmon with a caper-laced beurre blanc. Pea shoots with stracciatella is a simply wonderful side dish, while seasonal desserts are notable.
"
1019,"Plan ahead to secure tickets to this intimate den, where there are just a handful of seats and dinner is served only four nights a week. Dining here is a singular experience—though simple, the room flaunts an impressive fiber piece from a local artisan, custom-made tableware, and other hand-hewn furnishings.Chef Ryan Shelton arranges each of his meticulously-planned menus (which change seasonally) around a central theme, as in spring flowers or fall mushrooms. You might be enchanted by an alpine cauliflower meadow, featuring tiny crunchy florets with date hummus, before entering a fungi-laden forest. The latter is laden with canapés, including an oyster mushroom jambalaya encased in a maltose sphere--it's a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.
"
1020,"Located around the corner from the epoch-making Fillmore Theater, The Progress is a creative expression of the  union between top flavors and unique textures. Its kitchen team continues to execute a tome of ingenious dishes that are, in contrast, presented simply and carefully. The restaurant is flanked by dining hot spots, but regulars are here at all hours for its striking NorCal-meets-Nordic setting, warm, welcoming service, and notably ambitious cooking.Floor-to-ceiling windows, low lighting and a gentle soundtrack lull diners into a meal that practically sings. The menu may offer dishes meant to be enjoyed family-style, but go ahead and savor such luscious small plates as sturgeon caviar with light, crispy potato chips or a seamless pairing of heirloom tomatoes, Fiscalini cheddar, and almond romesco. Marinated in leche de tigre, thick fillets of halibut ceviche may then be combined with chilies and cucumber-coriander broth for a refreshing and fragrant feast.Save some indulgence for the end though, with the Josey Baker-red wheat apple fritter dredged in cinnamon-granulated sugar. Match this with a glass from their truly special wine list and find yourself craving more and more.
"
1021,"Welcome to the evolution of fine dining, where streams of plates are passed between guests in dim sum-style, and the supremely seasonal Californian cooking is always very good; even vibrant and surprising. You may not understand all of what you ordered at first, but prices are reasonable so pile on a few extras and try everything that comes your way. No one leaves hungry here.Servers circulate through the room carrying platters or pushing carts brimming with creative and utterly unique dishes. Highlights that will leave you begging for more include pan-seared dumplings—filled with tender, pulled guinea hen and earthy shiitake mushrooms—accompanied by a tableside pour of aromatic and umami-rich broth. Toast here puts the morning repast to shame, with black sesame balsamic, goat cheese, and grilled figs. Smoked duck with fingerling potatoes and creaming aioli is delightful, but that meyer lemon cheesecake with toasted hazelnuts and fig jam is a triumph. Be forewarned: getting a reservation here is the ultimate challenge and walk-in spots require lining up around 4:30 P.M. Best to avoid nights when large parties are booked, as this may negatively impact your experience.
"
1022,"This ambitious concept started life as a pop-up, before taking up brick-and-mortar residence. The ground floor—where patrons are greeted amidst splashes of blue and white—gives way to a moody, monochromatic, and swanky upstairs.The impressive menu pays homage to Chef/owner Rodney Wages' experiences at some of the city’s most elite kitchens. This is a successfully ambitious meal, driven by personality, creativity, as well as the influence of Eastern Asian and European cuisines. As your meal unfolds, it quickly becomes apparent that this chef marches to the beat of his own drum, creating unique combinations with equal deftness. For starters, he is on hand to pour from a lovingly curated selection of Champagne and sake to accompany the meal. Diners may then look forward to the likes of a coconut broth replete with bluefin tuna, Thai curry aromatics, and charred avocado; or tortellini in brodo with a burst of savory broth the moment you bite into them.In a final flourish, dessert arrives as both a modern expression (herbed granita with lemon curd) and ode to nostalgia in the form of a chocolate cake with a caramelized white chocolate- and popcorn-pudding.
"
1023,"Tucked into SF’s hilly hinterlands, in a quiet enclave away from the hubbub of the urban center, this Bernal Heights retreat has the potential to be overlooked. But, thanks to the steady hand of Chef/owner Greg Lutes (whose eclectic seasonal cooking earned him many a fan at a series of pop-ups that funded this venture) word was bound to get out. Locals now pack this intimate spot for hand-made pastas, like porcini- and black truffle-ravioli; as well as less conventional indulgences, like uni crème brûlée with caviar. Meaty mains like the Wagyu flat iron steak with maitake-bordelaise also hit the mark. Don't overlook dessert though. A pistachio cake with caramelized apples, white chocolate, and silky pistachio ice cream will seal your meal on a sweet note.
"
1024,"This local favorite always has a queue because everyone loves it—from tech bros in hoodies to families out for Sunday lunch. The jovial Miguel Jara runs this show—you may find him working the register or handing out roses to customers. Counter service makes it feel no-frills, but this is the kind of place that relishes in its simplicity.Everything here is supremely fresh, as exhibited in the open kitchen with its mountains of char-grilled steak alongside vibrant tomato, cilantro and onion. The carne asada super burrito is everything you dream it should be. It may not be on the menu, but order your taco “Dorado-style,” which begins as a corn tortilla crisped on the plancha, layered with cheese and another tortilla before getting loaded with toppings.
"
1025,"Pleasant and homey with excellent modern cooking, there is little wonder why this dining room is always bustling. Book in advance and assume that the counter reserved for walk-ins is already overflowing for the night. The space itself is slender with tightly packed wood tables and furnishings; it would seem cramped were it not for the soaring ceiling, skylights and open kitchen to brighten the mood. No matter where you look, the passion and enthusiasm for Italian specialties are palpable here—even contagious.From antipasti to dolci, celebrated Chef Matthew Accarrino’s extensive menu evolves with the seasons, yet remains as satisfying as it is impressive. And while the question remains of whether his creations are truly Italian or mingled with Californian elements, rest assured they are nothing less than memorable. Pastas are very creative and may include the supremely creamy acquerello risotto with mushrooms, prosciutto cotto and whipped espresso Bellavitano; or semolina gnocchi ""cacio e tre pepi"" starring smoked bacon and New Zealand spinach.Desserts feature the wonderfully sweet and tart flavors of maple panna cotta topped with wine-poached apple and delicious bits of cookie crumble.
"
1026,"In keeping with its location on boutique-y Fillmore Street, The Snug reimagines the neighborhood bar in a very au courant context. Dark wood is subbed for sun-drenched white walls, big windows are lined with an array of house-made tinctures and visitors might even spot that rarest of SF species—children—alongside the laptop-bound techies wrapping up the day with a 4:00 P.M. craft beer.Upscale but unpretentious, The Snug’s menu is serious for a bar, spanning both snacks (think green garlic fritters rolled in an umami-rich wasabi pea powder) and more substantial plates like charred octopus with smoked avocado purée, ramps and melon. They meld nicely with the refreshing draft cocktails, like the nitrogenated, mezcal-spiked take on a Last Word.
"
1027,"This deservedly popular pizzeria is tucked into one of the Mission District's most trendy corners. Fittingly, diners will be able to thoroughly enjoy their time here people watching—either from the quaint outdoor area or from the big, glossy windows overlooking Valencia Street.The pizza (also available at the takeout window by the slice, if you’re on the go) is excellent, fresh as can be, and blistered to sweet perfection. The pepperoni, bolstered with Calabrian chiles, is unusually good; but there are white pie options that are just as appealing (get a side of the surprisingly tasty house ranch if you’re feeling indulgent). Pair your pizza with antipasti, like marinated seasonal vegetables or tender meatballs with tomato sauce and a flutter of basil.
"
1028,"Respected veteran Chef Takatoshi Toshi has returned to his roots and taken over the reins to bring Novato locals hearty and affordable sushi. Don’t be surprised to see him behind the counter here, breaking down a whole salmon while making small talk with his neighbors. The space is simple, understated and quiet, which seems to match its quaint downtown location, set amid boutiques and restaurants.Lunch combinations are an excellent deal, offering chirashi bowls as well as sushi and nigiri with miso soup. Come dinner, the affordable omakase selection unveils nigiri, salmon and tuna tastings. Bigger platters might arrive as lovely amalgamations of avocado and albacore rolls alongside ebi, yellowtail and cherry wood-smoked goldeneye snapper (kinmedai).
"
1029,"This simple wood counter serves some of the area’s better nigiri, right from the corner of a mall in Japantown. Blink and you’ll miss it—Oma is about the size of a kiosk near the Webster Street exit.Behind the counter, find Chef Wilson Chan deftly slicing each morsel before your eyes, artfully placing it before every guest, piece by piece. Choose from five- eight- or twelve-piece prix-fixe menus to match your appetite and budget, though prices are reasonable for such quality. Clean flavors and rich, silky fish are the hallmarks of dining here. Highlights include a lightly torched wild star butterfish that melts in the mouth, and a delicious handroll combining chopped bluefin tuna balanced with pickled yellow daikon wrapped in crisp nori.
"
1030,"At the hands of accomplished Chef Dominique Crenn, guests have rightly come to expect a thrilling meal inside her singular atelier, replete with lustrous combinations, a keen understanding of flavors and an impeccable sense of grace. Another exclusive hallmark of dining here is the deeply hospitable and exemplary staff. They appear to float in and out of the kitchen, which in turn prides itself on a sense of poetry expressed figuratively through dishes and quite literally via the actual poem composed by Chef Crenn to her father—it's even etched into marble on display.Original is the name of this culinary game—one that is as thoughtful in serving brioche with cultured butter as it is with caviar crowned by turbot gelée and gold leaf. Spiny lobster with dots of apple butter and a warm ginger-whey foam is a wondrous creation brimming with flavor and depth. Not far behind, tender abalone with smoked mussel sauce and cabbage is deliciously divine.   The cheese course is stellar, but Pastry Chef/partner Juan Contreras’ desserts make for a novel finale. His snowflake, subtly redolent of eucalyptus, is a delicate iced invention that is as much a conversation piece as it is confection. 
"
1031,"This fine-dining dinner party has its origins as an underground phenom, but today anyone can try to score a seat, though the discreet entrance and clubhouse vibe still lend an air of sub rosa cool. Once you’ve tasted the no-holds-barred cooking, you’ll understand why the secret is out.The nightly tasting menu is served in a swanky, bi-level warehouse decked out like a business magnate’s hunting lodge. Diners are given a pencil and pamphlet informing them of the menu; there’s even a space for note-taking underneath, but this isn't a meal you’re likely to need help remembering. The menu has a sweeping creative scope, happy to draw on both nostalgia and current culinary trends with a confident swagger.Highlights include a trio of oysters, each dudded up according to a different fashion: raw with pickled ramp foam and rhubarb; broiled à la Rockefeller, in a creamy green garlic glaçage; or fried with a spicy XO chile oil and tangy ranch. Bold and brassy flavors presented with style and flair are a common thread, like in a final savory course of buttery A5 Wagyu ribeye paired with a delightfully dainty sweet-and-savory oxtail and sour cherry tart, perfect lattice crust, and all.
"
1032,"It may be located next to Chef Dominique Crenn’s notable Atelier Crenn, but Bar Crenn is a destination in its own right. Designed with an eye on Paris during Les Années Folles with a splash of speakeasy, this room is a flea market-chic amalgam of cozy lounge furniture, glinting chandeliers and vintage accents. Fine silver, crystal, champagne and caviar complete the decadence. The wine list is presented as a gold-embossed book of wooden pages.The classic French cooking strives to recreate many of the century’s great dishes through recipes on loan from culinary masters, such as Alain Ducasse and Paul Bocuse. The concise menu evolves with the seasons as it offers traditional cooking alongside some of Bar Crenn’s own creations. Fleur de Courgettes Farcies, a squash blossom filled with ground spot prawn, draws attention with its enticing presentation, while the tarte a la tomate's delicate, golden-brown crust is filled with a parmesan custard and topped with red and golden cherry tomatoes.  Desserts, like the Saint-Honoré embellished with créme chiboust and caramelized rounds of paté choux, are tiny but mighty.
"
1033,"Less mamacita and more Mother Earth, Gracias Madre is definitely not just another laid-back Mexican cantina. This is largely thanks to its strict sourcing standards (tortillas are made from scratch with heirloom corn) and wholesome plant-based food. Large portions showcase plenty of local produce, but that nacho cheese drizzled all over your butternut squash- and caramelized onion-filled tortilla is crafted from—nuts, of course. These colorful, vegan items explode with flavor, as seen in the enchiladas con mole packed with potato, zucchini and peas, then topped with tomatillo salsa, crema and avocado. The surprises keep coming throughout the meal.Take note of the flan, which created sans eggs still manages to have that trademark wobble.
"
1034,"At first glance, this stylish izakaya and sushi bar could be another in a line of similar places that dot the San Francisco landscape were it not for a major twist: everything on the menu is vegan. Purists and die-hard carnivores may scoff, but the food is exceptional, skillfully manipulating vegetables and starches to recreate seafood-centric Japanese favorites.Spicy tuna gets a run for its money from the impressive tofuna rolls, with chili-inflected minced tofu and cucumber, crowned with creamy avocado and dusted in chili “tobiko.” A yuba salad with miso dressing and tempura-battered shiitake mushrooms stuffed with faux-crab is equally compelling. Throw in a sleek, contemporary setting, and Shizen is a winner for eaters of all stripes.
"
1035,"This unobtrusive yet buzzy ramen house arrives courtesy of Chef Harold Jurado. His modest space displays a clean, streamlined décor, complete with rows of counter seats and a smattering of tables.The menu features Hawaiian favorites, like Spam musubi and pineapple-glazed grilled chicken; impeccably fresh ahi tuna poke; and of course, their delicious signature ramen. Behold the pork tonkatsu selection, for instance, which is utterly satisfying thanks to a 20-hour pork broth, bobbing with chewy noodles, smoky, melt-in-your-mouth chashu, soft cooked egg, and a flutter of bamboo shoots, green onion and black garlic oil. Those with dietary restrictions can opt for a gluten-free version, while an excellent mushroom-loaded option is a boon to vegans.
"
1036,"It’s always a fiesta at this lively spot on Cow Hollow’s main drag, where you’re as likely to find young families sharing a bowl of guac as you are Marina girls getting tipsy on mezcal margaritas. Patterned tiles, bright murals and chill beats create a modern vibe, and though you may have to wait (only limited reservations are available), the friendly staff will make it worth your while.Flores is among the city’s best upscale Mexican spots—with the bonuses of heftier portions and a lower price tag. You’ll be able to taste the difference in the handmade corn tortillas that encase an oozy huitlacoche quesadilla, and the tender, citrusy carnitas. Save room for churros: the spicy “Mexican hot chocolate” dipping sauce is well worth the calories.
"
1037,"This petite Hayes Valley delight is packed nightly and yet nobody seems to care about its stream of crowds. Simply decked with a light-and-dark color scheme along with distressed wood, the room features a laid-back style and rustic-chic farmhouse vibe. It books out far in advance, so arrive early to score a seat at the bar, where trendy types can be found devouring the Californian fare, infused with global ingredients and fine-dining precision.The hip staff is quick on their feet and may present diners with a salmon tostada slathered with tangy avocado purée and dots of salsa verde; or lobster chow mein garnished with charred corn and scallions. Advertised as dessert, cucumber sherbet with diced melon and watermelon granita is a perfect bite by itself.
"
1038,"You can try the pan-fried baos, poke at the crispy green onion pancakes and sample the hand-pulled noodles, but please, read the room—and the awning that wraps around the building. This casual eatery excels in the delicate art of soup dumplings, which arrive with supple skins and spoonfuls of delicious broth far clearer and more distilled than most. From open till close, chefs in the back wrap and fold everything by hand, and unlike most kitchens that are content to offer just a typical pork variety, fillings here include chicken, beef, and our favorite, a Sichuan-inspired numbing pork.A prime corner location in the Theater District lures in the crowds, who clearly work up an appetite by walking by table after table of bamboo steamers stacked to the sky.
"
1039,"Located just behind a beautiful wooden door with a carved owl and in a prime Hayes Valley location, Nightbird invites you into its nest with a small and sleek dining room. If you arrive early, don’t miss a delicious craft cocktail at their sibling spot next door, Linden Bar, as it’s the perfect lead-up to Chef/owner Kim Alter’s five-course tasting.Though the menu changes often, Alter’s presentations are consistently gorgeous. Witness a tender scallop “cooked” in yuzu juice, topped with uni, spring peas, radish, pea shoots and a truffle vinaigrette. Or go for a beautiful tableside presentation of white asparagus from the Loire Valley with paddlefish and salmon roe, a single leaf of nasturtium, as well as a drizzle of beurre blanc studded with escargot.
"
1040,"Chef Corey Lee’s take on timeless bistro cuisine is as sleek and striking as the space it’s served in. Fit for the cover of a magazine, this black-and-white dining room’s minimalist, yet intimate décor is trumped only by its pièce de résistance: an exhibition kitchen where you’ll find the meticulous brigade of cooks hard at work, producing impressively authentic French food.Begin with the pâté de campagne, enhanced with liver and shallots and presented with strong mustard, cornichons and country bread. The Arctic char amandine is excellent, dressed with fragrant beurre noisette and served over a bed of crispy haricot verts and sunchokes. For a sweet finish, purists will delight in the dessert menu’s île flottante.
"
1041,"Forty years young and still thriving as if it were newborn, locals and visitors remain drawn to this SF institution. Famous for its laid-back California vibe and great, locally sourced eats, this iconic space embraces its unique shape, and is styled with bold artwork-covered walls, a copper bar and wood-burning oven sending out delightful pizzas that fill the room with mouthwatering aromas.Given its ace location, Zuni makes for a divine lunch destination—and proof is in the many business folk, trendy ladies-who-lunch and tourists who fill its tables midday. Menu treasures include sliced persimmon scattered with shaved Jerusalem artichokes and baby arugula leaves, tailed by artisanal rigatoni clutching a fragrant lamb sugo.
"
1042,"Trust is the name of the game at Robin, a hip sushi-focused destination, where no menu is ever presented. Instead, guests happily submit themselves to the very capable skills of Chef Adam Tortosa and eagerly await his modern take on omakase. This kitchen’s decadent vision includes lots of elite ingredients like A5 Wagyu beef and caviar, though the staff will kindly ask what your budget is (or if you have allergies). The upscale space is a mix of posh and street cool—think graffiti-esque bathrooms and hip-hop beats. Young sushi chefs are the focal point of the room, working fastidiously with tweezers, torches and gel in front of a bright backdrop.A small, carefully curated list of beer, sake and wine pairs nicely with the food.
"
1043,"One should be so lucky to call Octavia their neighborhood spot. Swarming with locals from lower Pacific Heights, this pretty little dame is tucked among the Victorians that line the street. Sunlight streaming in through the windows lights up its reclaimed wood floors, while an open kitchen hums with activity.Culinary idol Chef/owner Melissa Perello is at the helm of this kitchen, which all but seals the deal on her extraordinary talent. She has a gift for elevating straightforward dishes with the use of top ingredients and well-executed technique. Dinner may begin with a mix of tomatoes, butter beans, and sambal; before moving on to pappardelle with summer squash, Genovese basil, and Pecorino di Filiano. Round it all off with the sourdough cheesecake.
"
1044,"At once playful and profoundly earnest, this privileged playpen is adored by the Bay Area's elite. The studied cool of the kitchen extends to its high dollar crowd; and the striking warehouse setting, blending rusticity with refinement, echoes the culinary approach—centered around the use of a live fire.The kitchen, headed by culinary director Paul Chung and Chef de Cuisine Richard Lee, proffers an immersive experience. Much of the menu is devoted to flawless seafood, like Maine lobster tail with slow-roasted pineapple. Leaving the ocean, dry-aged duck breast is an aromatic delight, enhanced with cherry leaf-infused jus and cooked to crisp perfection. In the end, a complex caramel gets a kiss of smoke and side of candied cocoa nib-studded ice cream.
"
1045,"Masaki Sasaki is well known among Bay Area sushi enthusiasts, having worked at a number of the area’s top spots. He’s finally settled into his own restaurant, housed on the ground floor of a quaint Mission Victorian. With only 12 seats at the counter, reservations are a must, but each guest is rewarded with personal attention from Masa-san.As with many high-end temples of sushi, only one omakase-style menu is offered. But Sasaki throws out the rulebook on proceeding from light to heavy fish. Commence with silky maguro, rich mackerel and creamy monkfish liver, before veering back to a lighter crab and pickled cucumber dish. A parade of nigiri is equally deft, with specially seasoned rice that is individually chosen for each type of fish.
"
1046,"As the name implies, two ingredients create a world of possibilities at this always-packed Mission hot spot. Neapolitan pizzas and handmade pastas (like al dente garganelli with whole-grain mustard and braised pork) will have you sighing after each bite, and a selection of more traditional mains (such as seared duck breast with chanterelles and pecorino-dusted charred Brussels sprouts) score every bit as big as the noodles and pies.Laid-back service, up-to-the-moment music and a buzzy, effervescent vibe make flour + water the epitome of California cool.Throw in a glass of their refined Italian wine, along with an alluring dessert like the salted caramel apple tart, and you can see why getting a table here is well worth the challenge.
"
1047,"Annie Somerville’s legacy of California cooking continues at this wholesome spot that's been around since 1979. Still, vibrant cuisine abounds, with a light touch and slight global inspiration. Brunch draws a crowd, so be prepared to wait for perfectly fried eggs over griddled potato cakes. Vegetarians and carnivores will rejoice after sampling the colorful and seasonal entrées at dinner, followed by such top desserts as huckleberry upside down cake with a subtle kick from Meyer lemon.Housed in a converted warehouse designed by Paul Discoe of Joinery Structures Fort Mason, the space is rustic but refined. A cheery aura as well as sweeping views of the marina and Golden Gate Bridge merely add to its appeal.For a quick bite, opt for the to-go counter.
"
1048,"Sri Lankan flavors infuse the dishes at this quiet winner, which also employs Western ingredients to arrive at its very own delicious concoctions. For a more extensive exploration of this island nation’s cuisine, go for the tasting menu. Or, lean untraditional with the lamprais, perhaps a French bacon-wrapped rabbit loin and eggplant curry stuffed into a banana leaf, or return to tradition with a classic hopper, a delicate fermented rice flour and coconut milk ""pancake"" that is especially elegant here.This contemporary space with its wraparound windows and slate walls is a perfect showcase for the cooking. Dine solo at the bar with a bittersweet Dubonnet sangria, or come with friends to share food and wine—the polished staff makes either experience enjoyable.
"
1049,"Hipster-friendly and Mission-approved, this is an instant hit for everyone from early happy hour drinkers through late-night snackers. Sidle up to the custom bay laurel bar for delicious (if pricey) cocktails made with unique liquors like gooseberry brandy. The menu focuses on small plates of refined comfort food, as well as creative presentations like tender sweetbreads tucked into grilled cabbage with broccoli spigarello and Caesar dressing. You may even taste an amuse-bouche from sibling restaurant Lazy Bear, such as crisp hen of the woods mushrooms with allium dip.Desserts seem straightforward but are beautifully crafted, especially the sweet, savory and even bitter combination of bay leaf-ice cream drizzled with new olive oil and citrus confit.
"
1050,"Delicate izakaya cuisine with a produce-centric NorCal sensibility awaits at this Japanese sanctum, where wood-framed booths crafted from redwood wine casks and a Hinoki cedar bar create a serene setting.The kitchen transforms even the most humble dishes into works of art. Starters like teba no karaage, or crispy chicken wings with tangy sansho pepper, are perfect for sharing, while Teishoku lunch sets are consistently good. Freshly made soft tofu is infused with fragrant bergamot peel, while meaty king trumpet mushrooms join classic chicken thighs and tender tsukune on the menu of smoky, caramelized charcoal-grilled skewers. The blancmange, infused with white sesame and topped with sweet black soybeans, is particularly unmissable.

1051,"A chic and sleek crowd of area foodies gathers at this trendy restaurant, nestled in a complex and right beside sister shop/deli Salumeria (by night it transforms for private parties), cocktail bar Trick Dog and coffee shop Sightglass. Wend your way to the central courtyard, with a trickling fountain and glass doors leading into the main space, where a vast open kitchen with a wood-burning hearth faces the simple wood tables.Along the way, you might taste a mound of burrata surrounded by melon cubes, cucumber slices and purslane tossed in a chili-herb vinaigrette. Gamey pork trotter agnolotti is balanced by lemon verbena; while smoked short ribs dotted with harissa and served with charred eggplant purée and mint sauce are fork-tender and flavor-packed.
"
1052,"For enticing Thai flavors in a charming setting, this  gem is hard to beat—boasting a dedicated following among the young techies and families who reside in this area's industrial lofts. The space is eclectic with art installations and flower arrangements that spin to the seasons. It’s the kind of affordable spot designed for repeat business.The menu is vast but mostly unchanging, with dishes that display attention to detail, bold flavors and top ingredients—think marinated flank steak rolled around cucumber or coconut- and turmeric-marinated barbecue chicken with sticky rice. Finish your meal with the rich and decadent mango sticky rice, featuring the ripe tropical fruit and rice kernels dyed a bright blue with butterfly pea flower--a signature touch.
"
1053,"Having settled into its new digs in the cultural mecca that is SoMa, diners now make their way through the front door (read: metal gate) and down a rather sexy, lantern-lit ramp to arrive at this temple of culinary fusion. And it is within this upscale arena that Chef Val M. Cantu, who takes great inspiration from Mexico, turns out a parade of familiar dishes made ultra complex and deliciously unique.The radiant servers merely enhance this deeply personal element by waxing poetic on every component on the plate in front of you. As with any kitchen of this caliber, ingredients on the multi-couse tasting menu are impeccably sourced from small farms across the state. Start with a quick succession of snacks, like a Oaxacan green masa tart filled with smoked sturgeon mousse, or a mini infladita filled with guajillo chileatole and crowned with Hokkaido uni. A sliver of grilled Cavendish banana is then presented with savory dulce de leche mounted with caviar; while a lamb chop with green garlic salsa and morels is accompanied by a fragrant lamb jus- lemon- and cilantro-broth.A scoop of buttery horchata ice cream with fresh strawberries and sweet coulis makes for a most memorable sendoff.
"
1054,"With its air of old-world sophistication, this is the kind of establishment where one dresses for dinner, and celebrants of a certain age are happy to splurge. The room feels embellished yet comfortable, with vaulted wood-beamed ceilings, warm orange walls and contemporary paintings.Chef Suzette Gresham's menus promise expertise and finesse, with a carefully curated wine list to match. Count yourself lucky if your meal begins with her famed parmesan budino surrounded by black truffle “caviar.” Pastas are another highlight, as in the rich and satisfying spinach ""creste di galli"" with Wagyu beef Bolognese. Pancetta-wrapped monkfish with creamy chestnut purée and nutty lentils is a sophisticated plate displaying the chef's deft skill.Desserts, like the buttermilk panna cotta may read humble, but are in fact infused with a bit of drama. Presented here like an egg, then sliced tableside to reveal an apricot sauce center, it is nothing short of a whimsical salute. Also save room for one of the best mignardises carts in town—stocked with superlative house-made chocolates, macarons, pâtes de fruits and caramels. The restaurant's sterling manners mean they'll send you home with a box of biscotti.
"
1055,"This modern North African supper club, which offers live cirque performances along with prix-fixe dinners on weekends, makes a fun, chill refuge for a meal with friends come weekdays. Drinks however are a priority here all week long; and not unlike their ace cocktails, Palestinian plus Moroccan wines pair perfectly with the food. The staff is incredibly warm and helpful, offering lots of suggestions for newbies to the cuisine.Can’t-miss dishes include the decadent duck confit bastilla, dusted with powdered sugar and fresh microgreens; as well as tender saffron chicken tajine, studded with brothy onions, slivers of preserved lemon and Castelvetrano olives. Flaky baklava, paired with a creamy scoop of pistachio gelato, makes for a decadent ending.
"
1056,"After working at a number of SF’s top restaurants, veteran sommelier Paul Einbund has settled down at this neighborhood charmer in the Mission, named for his father. Unsurprisingly, The Morris boasts a selection of wine, top-notch cocktails and a sophisticated, craveable comfort-food menu.Quell your hunger with slices of Tartine country loaf—baked just down the street—as you peruse the menu with appealing bites both small (pork cracklins with honey and Aleppo pepper) and large (charred broccolini with succulent grilled squid in chili-lime dressing). They have an extensive list of housemade charcuterie and the pâte de Campagne is a can't miss. Their signature smoked duck, brined for two days and aged for four, is a smoky, tender and meaty marvel.
"
1057,"Husband and wife team, Hyunyoung and Junsoo Bae, have ample fine-dining experience, but were inspired to strike out on their own to fill what they saw as a void in SF's Korean restaurant scene. The result is this tasting menu that draws upon the same nation's flavors, but sets itself apart with a sense of refined simplicity.Meticulously prepared seafood shows a dedication to craft, as in black cod partially dried before being grilled to achieve a skin so crunchy it can be heard from across the room. Beef short ribs are something of a signature, gently cooked sous vide, then seared to form a sweet-savory crust. Desserts end the meal with a feather-light touch, like a sorbet of magnolia berry over green plum granita, garnished with a black sesame leaf.
"
1058,"Thanks to its modern setting and late hours (by San Mateo standards, at least), a growing crowd of smart couples and tech types flock to this San Mateo sweetie. Everyone is here for the authentic Italian eats from Chef/co-owner Andrea Giuliani, who dishes up the cuisine of his native Veneto.The dining room has a view of the charcuterie-aging room and those artistically presented salumi boards of fennel-flecked finocchiona and exceptional salame al parmigiano. The wood-fired Neapolitan pizzas are equally strong—try the porchetta variation, topped with gorgonzola and radicchio. Of course, the pastas don’t disappoint either: spinach spaghetti amatriciana with house-cured guanciale, piennolo tomatoes, calabrian chilies, and pecorino is downright perfect.
"
1059,"This vast space is actually a 1910 firehouse replete with curving architecture, a beautiful bar and stairs that lead up to private rooms. The environment may seem upscale and contemporary, but don’t be afraid to bring the kids—crayons and paper cover the tablecloth and they just might score a balloon on the way out. The kitchen prides itself on being green, sourcing many ingredients from local farmers, using sustainable seafood, prime meats and doing their part for responsible waste management. Expect tasty renditions of familiar favorites, like big, crisp pieces of golden-fried calamari with zesty charmoula.Happy hour brings deals in the lounge, but come on Sunday night for half-price bottles of California wines, with plenty of pinots to choose from.
"
1060,"Reservations may be hard to secure, but rest assured that it is completely worth the effort to dine here. This is a dining room cherished by expats yearning for a taste of home as well as sushi purists snapping iPhone shots faster than you can say “omakase.” The setting is discreet in every way, with a tidy interior that consists of little more than eight seats, a cypress bar, and that ever-present chef’s work station.The menu is built around Edomae sushi, a style that Chef Akira Yoshizumi spent years perfecting in both Japan and New York. His training clearly pays off with food that is refined, delicate and beautifully balanced. Omakase highlights may include soy-glazed tako, delicate chawanmushi with squid and snapper; or grilled cod with finger lime and wasabi. Then move on to a parade of expertly crafted nigiri that is judiciously dressed and may showcase meltingly tender bluefin, rich ankimo, or seasonal buri dabbed with minced green onion for a zesty pop. Clean flavors shine in each course; garnishes and sauces are kept to a minimum. For instance, wonderfully firm and surprisingly mild geoduck sashimi arrives with nothing more than wasabi and a sprinkle of black sea salt.
"
1061,"Like a bracelet glittering with different jewels, All Spice is home to a bevy of vibrant dining rooms, made extra colorful with artwork and sparkling chandeliers. It’s a delightful blend of old-school charm and contemporary verve that appeals to a sophisticated crowd. They’re usually here to catch up with friends or celebrate a birthday.This kitchen offers a variety of creative selections on both the three- and five-course tasting menus, which spin to highlight the seasons. Chilled butternut squash soup in a shot glass makes a soigné amuse-bouche and is a delicious way to start a meal. Then a brick-shaped, perfectly cooked strip loin is accompanied by baby zucchini, pearl onions, confit mushrooms and smoked kale sauce for added enrichment.
"
1062,"This tiny spot is the perfect sojourn before or after a visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, thanks to its delectable and affordable Mediterranean food and friendly service. A diminutive and humble place, it has only six tables, but the chef/owner provides a warm welcome, recommending favorite items before he goes to work in the tiny back kitchen.Vegans and vegetarians will delight in the ample menu featuring flaky spanakopita, smoky baba ghanoush and vibrant tabbouleh with a perfect zip from fresh lemon. The tahini that accompanies the crisp, golden falafel is luscious, and a classic Greek salad is refreshingly satisfying. Don’t fill up completely though, as the homemade baklava, which just so happens to be vegan, is sure to sate and is available packaged to go.
"
1063,"The name and exterior of this ""factory” can be deceptive as it is pretty damn elegant, if even a bit stodgy on the inside. Imagine silk curtains, monogrammed seatbacks and other ornate touches, including a glassed-in greenhouse “conservatory.” If that’s not enough, white tablecloths, silver chargers and a menu listing “favorite” and “famous” dishes showcase decades of approval from tourists and elders.The menu is well executed but far from trendy, featuring a mix of classics like crispy sand dabs alongside ‘80s-glamour revivals like lobster ravioli in cream sauce. For those more open-minded however, the throwback theatricality can also be a lot of fun—from the ample bread basket with tomato-white bean dip to an engaging staff with fine-dining panache.
"
1064,"This buzzy dim sum restaurant may call the heart of Ghirardelli Square home, but it is hardly a spot just for tourists. The gorgeous, exotic space is fitted out with colorful light fixtures splashed with Chinese characters, delicate tiled murals, and flickering candle tea warmers.More substantial dishes like Ibérico pork char siu with compressed green apple and cognac glaze also merit attentionThe dim sum here is small (think a few pieces per order), but the menu is so ambitious you’ll see it as a great excuse to sample more food. Pork and duck puffs crafted into cute little black swans are Instagram-ready; and may be tailed by durian bao, tender squid ink dumplings with crunchy jicama and pork, or slippery rice crêpes filled with crispy soft-shell crab.
"
1065,"This little ramen shop is the first in the U.S.A. from the chef behind the highly popular Tokyo outposts, and its wait times are nothing short of epic—even in queue-crazed San Francisco. No matter how early you arrive, snagging one of the 28 communal seats is at least a 30-minute affair that can easily run up to two hours. And the dicey Tendernob address means the line is often beset by aggressive panhandlers.Only true aficionados can say if the ramen is worth it, but the tori paitan is one undeniably spectacular bowl, packed with springy, chewy noodles and outstanding duck chashu in a luxuriously creamy and umami-rich broth. Just know you’ll be asked to slurp it down quickly: the hungry, huddled masses outside are anxious to take your seat.
"
1066,"This up-and-comer in the sleek Proper hotel has style to spare—from its polished checkerboard floors all the way up to the floor-to-ceiling library shelves behind the stunning bar. No detail is too small here, especially those heavy etched glasses that hold complimentary sparkling water, and the smart shirts donned by the waitstaff. Even the gold flatware will catch your eye.The good looks extend to the plate as well, where the chef and team offer clever riffs on everything from Hawaiian sweet rolls topped with “everything” seasoning and served with a trio of spreads, to Japanese okonomiyaki, which gets a Spanish twist with prawns and chorizo.Seek out the outstanding cocktail list as it boasts 49 options, one for each square mile of San Francisco.
"
1067,"There are no yachts to be found at its current Mission residence, but hordes of locals and enthusiasts remain quite eager to book passage on Liholiho's love boat. Fusing Californian technique with the flavors of Chef/owner Ravi Kapur’s native Hawaii, this earthy, bustling, and airy space is known for strong cocktails, shareable plates, and near-impossible reservations. Walk-ins are welcome, but make sure you arrive in time to beat the crowds.Pivoted around a large, open kitchen, the dining room hums with groups savoring the likes of short rib bao or whole fried fish marinated with coconut and turmeric. If you turn your nose up at Spam, a Hawaiian staple, try the house-made version. It just might convert you.
"
1068,"Live fire is of the essence at this high-ceilinged and elegantly appointed dining room. Exposed brick walls ringed by celadon-green banquettes, rustic hardwood floors, and a stunning open kitchen with emerald, turquoise, and jade hues are some of the decorative touches; while hanging meats, bones, and that spire of smoke above the coals lend an inviting, lodge-chic feel.Chef Christopher Bleidorn's particular skill lies in his ability to combine the rugged appeal of flame-kissed meats with a delicate touch and palpable sense of whimsy. For proof, look no further than the lacquered quail with grilled Parker House rolls and crunchy pickles to be assembled by hand à la Peking duck. His team demonstrates an impressive variety of techniques that wring out every fleck of flavor from such pristine ingredients as creek trout, presented as roe with kelp kombucha sabayon; ""tail end"" lox served on crispy skin; as well as cedar-cooked loin with a jus made from the bones.The meal's playful and spontaneous spirit carries on until the very end—with the possible arrival of tart blueberries and silky crème fraîche hidden beneath a bee pollen-dusted tuile and bites of chewy lemon mochi. 
"
1069,"The elite meet to eat at this throwback favorite, which has been hosting the crème de la crème of the city (and its visitors) since the 90s. Set near Ghirardelli Square in Fisherman’s Wharf, it features two lovely wood-paneled dining rooms and a small, bustling bar, all of them regularly full of hobnobbing business types and couples celebrating big occasions. With bursting flower arrangements, attentive servers and well-dressed diners everywhere you look, it’s hard not to be captivated.The menu focuses on classic cuisine with some global twists; diners can create their own three- four- or five-course prix-fixe, or hand over the reins to the chef’s tasting menu. Luxurious dishes include a luscious rock shrimp and Dungeness crab risotto, accented with butternut squash; branzino with fennel purée, olives and a saffron-orange emulsion; as well as a perfectly cooked herb-crusted lamb loin, draped over date-studded farro and rainbow carrots.While Gary Danko may not be on the cutting-edge of fine dining, its top-notch wine list and outstanding service epitomize old-school luxury. Like the chocolate soufflé with vanilla bean crème anglaise that caps the meal, this is a classic for a reason.
"
1070,"A shiny gold door welcomes you to Niku, a buzzy, ultra-luxe steakhouse in the Design District, courtesy of the Omakase Restaurant Group. Executive Chef Dustin Falcon helms the kitchen, where pristine cuts of top shelf Japanese beef share screen time with hearty American cuts—the red hot binchotan coals create dream-worthy char.Service is all-around excellent, with suitably professional and stylishly attired servers. The swank, wood-lined interior features an array of cozy tables, but a seat at the handsome 18-seat chef’s counter is highly recommended, as you can watch Chef Falcon and company work their magic under the warm glow of the coals.Dinner might begin with perfectly al dente pea agnolotti in an airy butter sauce punched up with preserved Meyer lemon. Then move on the excellent steaks, like the Tomahawk built for two; or melt-in-your-mouth Imperial Wagyu filet mignon, served with 200-day-old kimchi, bordelaise sauce and sea salt. Don’t be afraid to use your hands to devour the Brentwood corn on the cob. Charred to perfection on the grill, it's then finished with a harmonious blend of sea lettuce aïoli, spicy togarashi, plum barbecue sauce and bonito flakes. 
"
1071,"Iberian flavors and Cali-cool join forces at this Spanish stunner, where legs of the namesake jamón ibérico de Bellota hang in a central glass case. They’re flanked by a sumptuous exhibition kitchen framed in bronze and hand-painted tiles, as well as a glamorous U-shaped bar. Chic professionals (some of them from the neighboring offices of Airbnb) have already staked their claim for date night.The menu adds seasonal touches to traditional Spanish tapas: picture yogurt-braised chicken albóndigas drizzled with pomegranate agridulce; or a fluffy tortilla Española with rainbow chard and chorizo crumbles. Paellas sized for 2-4 people are another popular option—try the Pluma, with Ibérico pork shoulder, summer squash and slivered squash blossoms.
"
1072,"This swanky spot in the Hotel Bijou is truly a tale of two cities—while the Tenderloin-bordering exterior is unassuming, the shimmering interior is a Gatsby-worthy altar of Deco glamour. But look beyond the ornate ceilings and aquamarine banquettes, and you’ll find a menu that revolves around live-fire cooking on an open hearth and a robust fermentation program with jars lining the kitchen walls. Saffron ravioli tucked with tender duck confit delivers unexpected flavors thanks to grilled squash, pickled cayenne and a rich broth. Chicken Milanese rests over grilled summer beans and peppers, but the blackberry crisp impresses with its thick and bubbling blackberry filling and oat crumble topping.Housemade soda is a thirst-quenching treat.
"
1073,"Tucked into an alcove of the unprepossessing Parc 55 hotel, this restaurant won’t win any awards in the décor department—it’s spare and casual, with tables set with chopstick canisters and bowls of chili oil. But when it comes to delivering authentically layered, fiery Thai flavor with a produce-driven northern California flair, it has no equal.Kin Khao's menu conjures up dishes from across Thailand and is a virtual homage to local purveyors. Imagine a meaty and rich five-spice noodle soup infused with duck bones and stocked with bok choy as well as delightfully tender duck leg confit; or a deliciously fresh take on som tum, with julienned green papaya tossed with golden tomatoes, long beans, dried shrimp and crushed red chili. More traditional options may include classic pad kee mao showcasing wide, flat noodles stir-fried with a potent mixture of ground pork bits, bell pepper, onion and holy basil.Needless to say, those avoiding spicy food or craving plain old pad Thai should look elsewhere. But, if you’re in the mood for a vibrant and zesty meal, then strap in for a wild and enticing ride. Come dessert, try the black rice pudding served warm and with myriad toppings.
"
1074,"If you’ve got eyes for pies, you’ll want to make a beeline to this chic and simple Italian hot spot. The open space is centered around a big, blazing oven and crowds arrive early to score every last no-reservations seat.Del Popolo may have gotten its start as a food truck, but one bite of their wood-fired pizzas and it's clear how it earned its address. Chewy, blistered and deliciously caramelized, the crusts arrive laden with toppings both traditional (mozzarella, crushed tomato and basil) and California cool (roasted winter squash, mascarpone, spring onions). Don’t sleep on the antipasti either, since the starters are first-rate. The lightly charred carrots set atop house-made yogurt and garnished with crispy red quinoa are dizzyingly delicious.
"
1075,"Can’t afford to indulge in the exquisite sushi at Omakase? Consider heading to its next-door little sib, where the fish is still top-notch (it’s all sourced from Japan) but the atmosphere is more laid-back. Okane draws lots of nearby Adobe and Zynga employees at lunch and big groups at dinner, all sharing bottles of sake and making the most of the small-plates menu.Sushi is, of course, a must: the nigiri is pristine and delicious, as are more Americanized rolls like the Harajuku (filled with shrimp tempura, avocado and salmon and topped with tuna, eel sauce and lotus root chips). But don’t sleep on the non-sushi dishes—cod marinated in sake lees is grilled to perfection, and broiled salmon aburi with avocado and ikura is delicious too.
"
1076,"True, the vibe is friendly and the location is convenient for tech entrepreneurs, but superb Edomae sushi is the real reason why Omakase is always full. Ergo, reservations are required and punctuality is a must. The kimono-clad servers strain to place dishes in front of diners, who usually sit elbow-to-elbow at the tight L-shaped counter, but the chummy young professionals and gourmands don’t seem to notice anything but the chefs.The menu features hand-picked fish from Tokyo's markets. Begin with buttery ocean trout steamed in sake and presented with a wedge of heirloom black tomato as well as an herb salad in rice wine vinaigrette. Beautifully arranged sashimi features bluefin tuna with red-fleshed sea perch, garnished with cured kombu, shiso leaf, wasabi and a bit of chrysanthemum petal salad. Still, no dish can compare with the exquisite level of nigiri, which may showcase marinated chutoro, cedar-torched sea bream, Hokkaido uni with house-brined ikura and a fluffy piece of lobster-infused tamago.Extreme attention to detail is the hallmark of dining here, with customized portions of rice and wasabi adjustments for each guest’s palate.
"
1077,"One of the city’s high-profile hangouts, this is the third effort from the team behind Marlowe and Park Tavern. Everything here has a British bent, echoed in the hunting-lodge-gone-sophisticated décor with red-and-blue walls accented by taxidermied trophies and tufted banquettes. Across-the-pond classics have Californian twists like a deep-fried Scotch duck egg wrapped in heritage pork sausage. The restaurant has quickly become a see-and-be-seen haunt of the tech oligarchy (complete with a private club). However, the food is spot-on and homey, as seen in the corned beef-and-potato hash topped with a gently poached egg.Though reservations are recommended, its location in the Hotel Zetta means service runs from morning to night, giving diners plenty of options.
"
1078,"Everyone at this inviting space is warmly professional, including the eager and well-paced staff. Add in the mature, stylish crowd and architecturally detailed dining room (a hybrid between your grandmother’s home and an art gallery with its black-and-cream palette, leather seating and vintage chandeliers) and you’ll be counting down the days until your next visit.Small but mighty, this kitchen under the guidance of Chef Teague Moriarty turns out a seasonal, ingredient-focused menu that consistently pleases with stark, stylized dishes and a sense of minimalism inspired from new Nordic and Japanese cooking. Vegetables are given their proper due, as in a grilled and dried beet full of earthy sweetness bolstered by fermented huckleberry and whipped bone marrow. This team shows its strongest suit in dishes of bold simplicity, where a grill-kissed Maine scallop is brushed with pine syrup and sauced with brown butter and green farro miso. Then lamb saddle and sweetbread is accompanied by a jus lifted with summer flavors.Desserts follow the thread of focused seasonality, as in a silken ice cream spun from jasmine rice koji matched with tiny, intense strawberries and poached rhubarb.
"
1079,"This restaurant is the crowning jewel to ONE65, the Financial District’s six-floor edifice to fine French cuisine. With a bakery, bistro and bar right below it, the dining room begins on the fifth floor—where you’ll find a modern design focused on the four elements and featuring cozy grey banquettes. Just above it, on the sixth floor, is the state-of-the-art kitchen, a chef’s table for eight guests, and a few private dining rooms.Chef Le Tohic's prix-fixe menu is composed of ten outstanding courses that may pair classic French techniques with pristine Californian ingredients. Exquisite sauces work their way into this rotating lineup that begins with a generous trio of caviar with freshly baked breads; and ends with an enticing mignardise cart, starring bite-sized bon bons, pâte des fruits, cakes and so much more.In between, you might find such highlights as a strikingly intricate zucchini cannelloni—its alternating green and yellow ribbons filled with diced zucchini and garnished with crisp tempura flowers; or succulent lobster in Chambertin sauce with pickled onions. A separate plate of more tender lobster, tangy purple cabbage and pepper berry bearnaise simply augments this already decadent dish.  
"
1080,"This restaurant is divided into two equally lively spaces: a bar packed with millennials drinking Italian vino while nibbling crostini; and a dressier dining room where a sophisticated crowd settles in for a multi-course meal. Others may choose to venture into the heated outdoor patio to sip rosé and watch the cable cars go by.Much of the menu seems ideal for sharing, particularly snacks like fried olives stuffed with oxtail, giardiniera and grissini. Don’t miss the chicken liver pâté crostini with apple, mint and flower petals. You may want to keep the house-made pasta all to yourself, with offerings like two large ravioli doppio—one packed with ricotta and spinach, the other with wine-braised veal—in a lovely jus with Meyer lemon, English peas and fava.
"
1081,"The breadth and complexity of Indian cuisine gets its due at this tasteful retreat, tucked into a posh hotel just steps from the luxury boutiques of Union Square. Attired in a soft palette of cream and white, with a striking central glass light fixture, it's a smooth showcase for the freewheeling, colorful food from Chef Srijith Gopinathan.Diners have a choice of vegetarian or omnivorous dishes from the four-course tasting. Meanwhile, the six-course Spice Route menu tempts the high rollers in the room. Either way, you’ll be sent on a riotous journey through different textures, flavors and temperatures, along with some truly whimsical platings. Whether it’s a pea-shoot “flowerpot” with quinoa soil or a frozen stone bearing persimmon-kulfi popsicles, the chef's panache is sure to garner wide smiles.That’s not to discount this kitchen's exceptional use of flavors as relished in the butter-poached lobster dressed with a coastal curry derived from the chef's grandmother’s recipe, or the crisp dosa matched perfectly with a filling of sweet day boat scallops. Cauliflower roasted on charcoal with tomato tokku, kohlrabi and yogurt paired with fluffy kallappam makes for yet another high point.
"
1082,"The simple pleasures of tacos and beer get taken to the next level at this laid-back spot, where hand-ground, hand-griddled blue corn tortillas star on every corner of the menu, and craft brews leave Corona in the dust. With just one chef and one bartender, the service is nonetheless friendly and personal—with a healthy dose of genuine passion for the food (and a fun classic rock soundtrack).Snag an IPA before taking a full lap of the short menu: freshly fried chips with outstanding guacamole, warm tortillas piled with achiote-marinated pork and pickled onions, as well as a gooey Oaxacan cheese quesadilla stuffed with tender chicken. A trio of house-made hot sauces (including a habanero “death sauce”) make for the perfect grace note.
"
1083,"Though it has the feel of a chichi private club, this attractive restaurant is open to all—provided they can live up to the style standards set by its fan base of tech tycoons and ladies-who-lunch. Draw your eyes away from those sleek wheels in the parking lot, and head inside for fine dining that exceeds this sophisticated restaurant's humble name.Despite the glitz, the cuisine here is surprisingly approachable, from platters of house charcuterie served with fire-warmed artisan bread to the superb lobster bisque with braised new potatoes and fennel available in both the cozy front lounge and more formal dining area. It’s there that the kitchen shines its brightest though, with such elaborate entrées as ricotta gnudi neatly arranged with chanterelles à la Grecque, tender squash and golden raisins. The popular key lime tart is an equally impressive display—its crisp and perfect shell topped with toasted marshmallows, viola petals and meringue batons. On a budget? Aim for lunch, which is lighter not only in approach, but also on the wallet.Given the clientele, the wine list is designed to court the deepest of pockets, with an outstanding selection of French vintages, particularly Bordeaux.
"
1084,"Zero Zero may be named for the flour used in its pies, but it is so much more than a pizzeria. While the Castro topped with mozzarella and soppressata is delicious, this casual spot offers far more than just a good slice. At lunch, its bi-level space is packed with young techies, families, and business folk from the Moscone Center. A sizable bar ensures that everyone has a sip to go with such shareable staples as the crispy arancini packed with Taleggio, puddled in black garlic aïoli, and garnished with arugula. The creative and well-charred judah pizza is yet another favorite, decked out with bacon, mozzarella, and shishito peppers.If you have a sweet tooth, indulge in the Calabrian chili caramel, or keep it classic with a hot fudge and soft serve. 
"
1085,"Be sure to pay attention to your surroundings as you are likely to walk right past this secret gem. Sans signage, it may look like a typical sushiya from the outside, but appearances are deceptive and the food offered here is in fact mighty popular. Those planning on dining in will want to make a reservation, as the small, industrial space—especially those coveted dark wood counter seats—is packed most nights of the week.Chef/owner Ray Lee does wonders with nigiri from around the globe, including New Zealand king salmon and full-flavored Cyprian sea bream. Cooked plates like gently fried agedashi tofu, in a flavorful broth accented with “pearls” of ikura, are just as appealing, as is the salmon belly topped with a mountain of shaved black truffle.
"
1086,"Some like it hot, and here they are in heaven. Be forewarned: timid palates should steer clear of the super-spicy Sichuan dishes that have made Z &amp; Y a Chinatown smash hit. Nearly every dish is crowned with chilies, from the huge mound of dried peppers that rests atop tender, garlicky bites of fried chicken to the flaming chili oil anointing tender, flaky fish fillets in a star anise-tinged broth with Sichuan peppercorns aplenty.The well-worn dining room may seem unremarkable and the service perfunctory, but the crowds are undeterred. Plan to wait among eager fans for a seat; then settle in for delicate pork-and-ginger wontons swimming in spicy peanut sauce and more chili oil. Allot time to navigate the challenging parking situation.
"
1087,"Café Jacqueline is a restaurant from another time, but for those who appreciate its eccentricities, it’s a total treasure. Savory and sweet soufflés big enough for two make up the entirety of the menu, but getting one requires endurance.Reservations are by phone only, though the staff rarely answers, and tuxedo-clad servers don’t so much serve as they do command—handling tables in a direct but never offensive manner. They are also unapologetic about just how long this candlelight dinner will take: three hours, for most, as every towering soufflé is made by the grand dame herself, who’s been whipping egg whites for nearly 40 years. From broccoli and brie to Grand Marnier and chocolate, dinner here is a special affair unmatched in its romanticism.
"
1088,"In SF's dizzyingly expensive dining landscape, this hot spot offering a three-course menu for under $40, is an incredible steal—provided you’re willing to sacrifice freedom of choice. The two options for each course spin with the season: your repast may feature a creamy heirloom tomato soup with thyme oil, followed by fork-tender short ribs atop luscious parmesan polenta and spigarello—with a final touch of frozen chocolate parfait garnished with crushed cashews.For those with appetite to spare, an additional pasta course (like ziti al forno with dry-aged beef ragù and gremolata topping) can be added for a small supplement. Throw in a lively atmosphere and friendly service to this already alluring deal, and the value proposition is nearly irresistible.
"

The neighborhood's food-obsessed techies along with a host of tourists flock to this boldly designed space, replete with soaring ceilings, glowing central columns and a superb (suspended) wine cellar. The crowd is contented and lively, and while the servers fit the bill, the sommelier is especially impressive.Chef Lahlou's expression of Moroccan cuisine is peppered with local and contemporary influences like maple and brown butter, as well as more traditional inflections such as charmoula and preserved lemon.Diners may commence with the likes of basteeya, which is typically a traditional Moroccan pastry made modern with finely shredded duck and then enhanced with verjus crème fraîche, compressed pear, edible flowers, as well as a rich cocoa paste.Couscous may then be presented all jazzed-up with savory brown butter and a parade of vegetables, before it is hit with spicy harissa for a slight kick—and delightful send-off.

1090,"Benu is an oasis in the heart of the city. The mandatory stroll through the courtyard not only sets the mood, but also offers insight into the meal to come. Peruse the onggi pots with fermenting ingredients you'll later find on your plate and glimpse the kitchen hard at work. The interior is awash with earthy hues and sleek banquettes, and the serene dining room with clean lines draws the eye across its meticulous design. Service is impressively warm and relaxed.Patience seems to define this kitchen in its relentless pursuit of excellence, whether that may be perfecting technique or waiting for just the right moment to serve an ingredient at its peak. Meals begin with a series of highly technical small bites. While these delicacies alone may rival some of the country's most ambitious tasting menus, there's more. Faux-shark's fin and xiao long bao are a delightful classic, but Chef Corey Lee continues to reimagine and redefine his nightly offerings. Dishes like barbecued quail with house-made XO sauce and an elevated take on traditional Korean beef barbecue convey a distinct personality and reflect a singular marriage between contemporary Asian influences.
"
1091,"Though it feels like it’s been around for decades, celebrity chef Tyler Florence’s FiDi favorite is actually a toddler—at least in tavern years. In fact, it’s become a standby for business types doing deals or enjoying post-work cocktails. Complete with dark wood and leather furnishings, a private billiards room and bustling bar, Wayfare Tavern has the air of a gastropub-turned-private club.Hearty Americana with seasonal accents defines the menu. Meals here usually begin with piping-hot popovers, and then proceed to buttermilk-brined fried chicken—both of which are the chef’s signature dishes.

Inside, a stunning counter crafted from a piece of live-edge elm, oyster-hued leather chairs and a ceiling of wood slats complete the Japanese-chic look.While the preparation of their nightly omakase might seem like a production line by employing myriad cooking techniques, the kitchen ensures that every bite is memorable. Begin with warm kelp tea, before embarking on a sashimi parade of bluefin slices served with a yuzu-onion-sesame sauce. Then, savor softshell crab soup in a corn and sweet miso broth before a top rendition of sushi yields Santa Barbara sea urchin atop Hokkaido scallop and snapper with cured egg yolk shavings. 
"
1093,"Sequestered within an office building in the Financial District, this counter is a sensory pleasure.

Expectedly, diners are treated to a breathtaking culinary experience from start to finish—as well as service that is effortless, unobtrusive, and engaging. The itamae are also eager to share their knowledge, as they bestow upon patrons a parade of marine treasures. Chawanmushi is delicate and silky, studded with fava beans and borage flowers. Then comes the impeccably knifed nigiri, interspersed with small composed dishes, both of which highlight seasonal delicacies. Imagine the likes of kasugo nigiri, featuring jewel-skinned fillets of young seabream, as well as tiny firefly squid with broccoli rabe, white miso, and mandarin.This meal is a consummate study in ingredient purity.
"
1094,"Though rustic compared to high-end sibling Quince just next door, Michael and Lindsay Tusk’s casual offshoot would be elegant by any other standard. Exposed brick, a shiny copper chef's counter and bar, wooden tables...it's Italian to a T, and a hot-ticket reservation.The space centers around an exhibition kitchen, from which crisp pizzas and hearty roasted meats emerge. The absolutely delicious menu highlights Chef Tusk’s pristine pastas, like agnolotti del plin, stuffed with tender rabbit, veal and pork. Seasonal starters are equally pleasing, like kale and radicchio salad in a tangy vinaigrette with hard-boiled farm egg and pecorino. The rustic plum and ginger torta is moist and delicious, but those ever-so-sweet, ripe plums steal the show.

Following suit, the stunning room is as inviting as ever, allowing more space for private parties.There was a time when Quince was home to traditional cooking, but Chef Michael Tusk’s menu is increasingly contemporary. To wit, a beautiful glass vessel with golden osetra caviar is set atop a delicate oyster panna cotta for a deliciously high-brow starter. This may be tailed by a special plate of tortellini, which when filled with pork, parmesan and tossed in beurre blanc, forms the very picture of delicacy. Venison coated with vegetable crumbs and enriched by potato purée, quince and chestnut makes for a particularly delightful entrée.Of course, that mignardise cart is a sight to behold with such dazzling treats as the kouign amann filled with huckleberry jam, macarons and chocolates.

One such example of his haute-humble ethos is the summertime-perfect cherry tomatoes pooled in strawberry juice with fennel pollen. Simple, seasonal flavors just seem to pop here, with the menu balancing such throwback favorites as popcorn grits and poached, then grilled lamb. However, newer items like the fluke cured in kombu is certainly a dazzler thanks to a touch of fermented black bean sauce. Then smoked black cod wrapped in scallop mousse takes a beautifully cooked piece of fish and dresses it up with a purée of herbs that not only delivers vibrant flavor, but also adds a splash of color. Find that same sense of ingenuity and decadence in ribbons of celtuce and buttery new potatoes layered with creamy comté and black truffle.The frozen lime marshmallow with coal-toasted meringue atop zesty lime ice is sealing testimony of what this kitchen can truly do.

1097,"Slick financial types flex their expense accounts at this longtime Northern Italian retreat. Its polished décor belies a comforting menu of dishes executed with care—from slow-roasted vitello tonnato and semolina-dusted petrale sole to handmade pastas.

"
1103,"With a higher price tag than the average Chinatown joint, Yank Sing is arguably the place in town for dim sum. The upscale setting boasts reasonable prices, but the zigzagging carts can get hectic. While peak hours entail a wait, one can be assured of quality and abundant variety from these carts rolling out of the kitchen.The signature Peking duck with its crispy lacquered skin and fluffy buns makes for a memorable treat, not unlike the deliciously sweet and salty char siu bao.

Just ask the cheerful staff, who’ll radio the kitchen for help via headsets.

1104,"You'll need to look farther down the block than your GPS indicates to find this slightly secret haven. Make your way inside to discover a décor that's as subtle as the entrance, except for the flash of the binchotan with its bright flames taking center stage. Gozu is a carnivore's mecca, paying homage to the cow with a Wagyu tasting. Only one cow is ordered at a time and great care is taken to respect the animal by highlighting all possible forms, but don't expect a simplistic parade of meats though. Albacore tataki arrives with tuna slices seared on one side, then finished counter-side with whiskey vinegar, Wagyu garum and kale ""nori"" for crunch.

Thick, steakhouse-style onion rings arrive with a brilliantly crisp coating of potato flakes. This kitchen certainly does not limit itself to a single cuisine. Take, for example, the chicken fat-butter rice with Dungeness crab, which would fit right in at any Asian restaurant.Like its surrounds, the space is neutral yet breezy as can be, with an A-frame roof that reaches for the sky and sleek concrete floors.
"
1131,"It takes effort to visit this remarkable little noodle bar, as it’s located in deep industrial West Oakland, open only at dinner and waits can run upwards of 45 minutes—if the designated 100 daily orders of soba don’t sell out first. But rest easy as this delay is happily passed with a drink in the sunny garden, and the warm hospitality rewards the hassle.Handmade Japanese noodles come in two varieties: 100% or 90% buckwheat, served hot or cold in dishes like tenseiro, chewy cold soba with feather-light tempura shrimp and vegetables alongside a flavorful dipping sauce. For something warmer, kamo nanban, a rich broth with tender slices of duck breast, hits the spot. Be sure to sample the sake, served here in the traditional “overflowing” style.
"
1132,"The word is out about this tiny, omakase-only Japanese gem, located adjacent to Swan’s Market in Old Oakland. It’s a simple, casual space with a small counter and handful of tables, but it also provides a fine spotlight for a mixture of high-quality nigiri and kaiseki dishes.Meals typically run about eight courses, with seasonal starters like a grilled apricot and mizuna salad; salmon sashimi adorned with a slice of Saturn peach; or garlic shoots enhancing seared Miyazaki beef.Excellent nigiri, from tuna to mackerel to fluke, arrive at intervals alongside other captivating items, like seared duck breast with moro miso or scallops with shiso and umeboshi. The only downside is that reservations can be a challenge—so be sure to plan well ahead.
"
1133,"Even on the coldest (a.k.a. 50-degree) Oakland day, the soul-warming Caribbean cuisine at this little cutie will transport you to the islands. Barbados-born Chef/owner Sarah Kirnon named her restaurant after her grandmother, and it now serves up many of her childhood favorites, including plump, sweet grilled shrimp in a jerk marinade and some of the best fried chicken in town—with a flaky golden-brown crust.Housed in the historic Swan’s Market building in Old Oakland, Miss Ollie’s has a particularly loyal crowd of lunchtime regulars, who sip tart ginger limeade as they liberally dose their food with the excellent Scotch bonnet hot sauce. With all the colorful art on the walls as well as a welcoming staff, it's a rustic slice of Caribbean soul.
"
1134,"This bright orange and yellow building looks big enough to be a warehouse, which makes sense as the inside is not only a counter-service restaurant but also a market. Its namesake chaat may be the star here, but lunch specials are a fantastic bargain. For $15, you can get perfectly tender tandoori chicken with a mouthwatering smoky char, served alongside basmati rice, dal, raita and papadum. Family-friendly and casual, this Indo canteen seems to attract everyone with its excellent chaat, authentic flavors and breads—especially the fried and puffy bhature ideal for sopping up spicy chole. A glass case filled with colorful sweets reminds everyone to save room for dessert.The kitchen closes early at dinner, so unless you’re an early bird, go for lunch.
"
1135,"Tacubaya is so beloved by locals that they moved a few doors down to an expanded space in an attempt to accommodate its enlarged fan base. This taqueria in the Berkeley shopping complex is where families flock to grab a bite during errands. In fact, there is a perpetual line of patrons ordering limeade at the counter and claiming seats in the festive dining room (look out for the hanging pink papel picados) or sunny front patio.They are here for chilaquiles and churros at breakfast; then transition into chorizo-and-potato sopes with black bean purée at lunch. Other standbys unveil beef enchiladas doused in a smoky guajillo-tomatillo sauce and covered with melted cheese; followed by tamales de verduras bested with spicy salsa verde and cool crema.
"
1136,"Japanese techniques and Californian ingredients blend harmoniously at this charming getaway, which flaunts a buzzing dining room and delightful (heated) patio. Start the evening off with a selection from the excellent (and well-priced) local wines, creative cocktails, or well-curated sake list. Then, order a variety of small plates for sharing.This is a menu that changes regularly, although every dish is carefully crafted to delight the senses. The heady yasai taki salad, with grilled vegetables, enoki mushrooms, and black garlic tamari, leaves a lasting impression; not unlike a crudo of pristine hamachi, which arrives with a dusting of wasabi snow. Manila clams enhanced with a broth of sake, bacon, potatoes, and shiitakes is an aromatic wonder.
"
1137,"This Pacific Renaissance Plaza spot is a restaurant within a restaurant. Set on the second floor, it shares acreage with Sakura as well as the patio that overlooks downtown Oakland. The room is simple, with a host stand greeting diners. A long bar resides on the left; white booth seating on the right; and black tables run down the middle. A striking wall display of bottles puts diners in the mood for a sip before they sup. Service can be spotty, but all is forgiven when the Sichuan menu, complete with the classics, is presented. Portions are hefty, so bring a buddy and indulge in such refreshing starters as a lotus root salad with ginger and garlic sauce. This may be tailed by the likes of fiery mapo tofu or chongqing chicken for a tongue-numbing finish. 
"
1138,"This handsome stallion is certainly a feather in the cap of the inviting, if slightly sleepy town of Saratoga. There has been a Plumed Horse in this spot since 1952, though this decade-old iteration is by far the best. The décor inside exudes warmth, first in the fireplace-warmed lounge, then in its stunning dining room, with sleek arched-barrel ceiling. From shimmering Venetian plaster to striking chandeliers that emit a colorful glow, these rich details create a sensational backdrop that is at once elegant and comfortable.This inventive kitchen team turns out a menu of modern and upscale cooking. Duck consommé, poured tableside and enhanced with meaty mushrooms as well as a bright English pea flan, is as impressive to the eye as it is to the palate. Then locally sourced abalone is finished with XO sauce for a pop of flavor, while the decadent black pepper- and parmesan-soufflé accompanied by a delicate petal of uni is of the dive-right-in variety.Almond cake with cocoa-nib mousse and orange foam is decadent, but wait until those chocolates arrive. Wheeled over in a glass-domed cart with row-upon-row of treats from Chocolaterie by Angelica, these gems are nothing less than exquisite.
"
1139,"Lovers of regional Mexican food will swoon for this laid-back charmer, which offers full-throttle fare made with quality ingredients. The colorful little building has a strange layout (order at the counter, then pass through the kitchen to dine on the patio), but it still draws a large following—expect to chat with fellow diners hungry for intel on the day’s best dishes.Entrées shift with the seasons, but the preparations are always expert: try the halibut ceviche with house-made chips or the red mole tamales chockablock with chicken and just a touch of masa. The Bohemia beer-battered fish tacos featuring handmade tortillas are a must, as are the addictive poblano-tomatillo nachos verdes. Of course, spice fans can't get enough of the crispy chilaquiles.
"
1140,"Look completely past the strip mall location and head into this storefront for some of the more nuanced Thai cooking around. Pop music and colorful plastic tablecloths create a leisurely, relaxed mood. This kitchen is helmed by an ex-Hawker Fare chef, so expect spice blends and house-made curry pastes at the base of each dish.The menu is small but mighty, with items that exude a playful spirit. Nowhere is this clearer than in the “party wings,” which sound like a good time but in fact have great depth of flavor. Nam kao todd is coated in a house-made red curry paste, fried until crispy, hit with fish sauce and layered with tendrils of pork skin and crumbles of fermented pork for a vibrant taste with just the right amount of heat. 
"
1141,"This Spanish delight from the team behind acclaimed caterer Ñora Cocina Española does double duty as a mecca for both tapas and paella, offered in varieties from the traditional mixta (prawns, chicken, chorizo, garlic, peppers) to the inventive “tres cerditos” (three little pigs) featuring pork chorizo, shoulder and belly. The classic tapas are also out in full force—from grilled head-on garlic shrimp and salt cod croquettes with nutty romesco, to tortilla Española.Located on busy San Pablo Avenue, the lively space offers enticements for groups of all sizes: foursomes can make the most of the sizable paellas, while a duo of happy hours offer discounts on wine at the L-shaped bar and a selection of free tapas, perfect for solo diners or couples.
"
1142,"On the quaint island of Alameda comes this causal concept from restaurateurs, Mike Yakura and Danny Sterling. The entrance is in keeping with its industrial interior design, complete with a counter and kitchen in full view, exposed ductwork, and an indigo-blue ceiling.Billing itself as a Californian rotisserie, the menu is also strewn with Hawaiian and Japanese accents—behold such unorthodox sides as a Napa slaw, with pickled red kraut, carrot, and creamy sesame dressing. Top-notch meats take center stage, with starters (corn fritters with strawberry jam, anyone?) to boot. Marinated in koji and fermented rice, these umami-packed cuts are then grilled to rosy perfection. Desserts, like butter mochi cake with whipped cream, boast a light-as-feather texture.
"
1143,"Downtown Albany is abuzz about this chic arrival named for the mother and grandmother of Chef/co-owner Scott Eastman. It has all the accoutrements of a fancy local joint—think unique sculptures from an area artist, rustic plates and fun craft cocktails like the rum- and coconut-based White Picket Fence. And yet, this rookie eschews the tragically hip crowds for an easier, more communal feel.The roving menu is heavy on odes to seasonal produce, like a succotash of summer squash, corn and cherry tomatoes topped with flaky halibut. You'll also be able to taste the chef’s nine years of cooking at Berkeley favorite—Corso—in his perfect veal Bolognese sauce. Creative, well-balanced desserts like a creamy banana custard with coconut granita are menu musts.
"
1144,"It is definitely all in the name at this vivacious and cheery spot where dumplings are the star of the show. Watch them being made in the open kitchen, then consult the chalkboard for featured menu items. Scallion pancakes and beef noodle soup make an appearance, but press forward to some of the more offbeat items. Peanut salad is tossed with bright celery and crinkle-cut carrot shavings to deliver a wonderful texture and flavorful crunch, but oh those dumplings. Bursting with traditional fillings or more unusual combinations like sweet corn and chicken or scrambled egg and tomato, these delicious parcels are a meal unto themselves with hearty portions rounding out each order.You'll leave pleasantly stuffed with plenty of cash remaining in your wallet. 
"
1145,"Right off Embarcadero and just a few minutes south of Jack London Square, Brotzeit Lokal looks and feels like a classic German beer hall, albeit with great water views. It's a casual, convivial place with long tables and benches that beg for groups to connect over beer and Bavarian pretzels (served with mustard or cheese spreads, naturally). The menu reads like the greatest hits of German cuisine with hearty favorites including schnitzel and house-made sausages, served with a platter of sides from sauerkraut to spaetzle. The potato pancakes, golden brown and soul satisfying, would make any oma proud. Like the rest of the menu, desserts steer traditional, though pretzel bread pudding, laced with salted caramel and apples, is particularly clever.  
"
1146,"It may take a little digging to find this place, since there are no signs and you must ascend a steep flight of stairs, but once inside, you'll discover an ambitious Japanese restaurant where the kitchen deserves as much praise as the eight-seat sushi counter. The okimari menu begins with a clean and simple dish of ohitashi, or blanched romesco in a dashi broth, then continues with nanbanzuke, a lightly fried and intensely flavorful fish. Skillful sashimi and a selection of sushi follow, including horse mackerel brushed with sweet soy and a dot of yuzu, seared Japanese whitefish, okra  topped with bonito flakes and fried Japanese eggplant, which takes a humble ingredient and steals the show. Black sesame ice cream rounds out the meal.  
"
1147,"Culinary devotees flock to Aptos for its deluxe food spots, boutique coffee shops, and supermarkets aplenty. Jumping on the bandwagon is this delicious operation with a single mission—to churn out the most memorable and addictive pizzas in town.Soft hues, dark green-framed doors, and a barn-like structure foster a communal sense. The carte is unusual, unveiling fried sardines with Meyer lemon aïoli or white bean soup with chickpeas in a prosciutto broth. Taking the cake however are pizzas, like the ""Pesto"" shimmering with fromage blanc, Crescenza, and caciocavallo, or Sardenaira with tomato sauce, anchovies, and olives. If great pizza is the stuff of dreams, you may want to skip the house-made pistachio ice cream. But, is that a risk worth taking?
"
1148,"The Sonoma Plaza lucked out with this little wine bar that is sure to be a gamechanger for the area. Its vibe is come-as-you-are; and the tiny menu is a revolving door of fresh ingredients prepared with little fuss. The affordable wine list is a veritable call to adventure, highlighting organic and biodynamic favorites from the nooks and crannies of California and beyond.It wouldn’t be so unreasonable to eat here either. From soft-boiled eggs finished with a savory XO sauce to duck breast tortillas served with house-made hoisin that is best in class, everything is better shared. For dessert, olive oil cake with yogurt and orange-citrus marmalade is yet another illustration of how this team under-promises but over-delivers in the most welcome of ways. 
"
1149,"Housed in a converted Victorian in downtown Mountain View, Chez TJ likes to kick it old school. Make your way down a path and past a pretty front porch to arrive at this delightful haven. Inside, four separate rooms welcome diners, each boasting their own design style. Romance is in the air, and details like vintage lamps, wallpaper, and elegant table settings pave the way for some very fine dining.Under its current leader, Christopher Lemerand, this kitchen showcases contemporary cuisine by way of a single tasting. There are numerous courses, each unveiling refined, nuanced, and well-executed dishes. Start with the likes of pommes soufflé with Kaluga caviar; parsnip meringue set atop a chicory ""sable""; followed by a twist on the classic ""Reuben"" starring crusty rye bread, aged Wagyu, kraut, and cheese. Chicken-fried quail stuffed with kale and served with an earthy red-eye gravy is comfort on a plate; Dungeness crab with a ""pocket"" of its own cloud-light mousse is quite simply irresistible.Dip your spoon into desserts like preserved satsuma mandarin curd or chocolate cake with huckleberry ganache. Equally dreamy, wines here run the gamut with selections offered by the half-glass—just ask.
"
1150,"It takes a village to feed a big group, and this laid-back spot is a favorite with families. A stylish makeover featured a sleek front bar, contemporary chandeliers and dramatic Chinese art, but one look at the scorching-hot menu options—think spicy Sichuan frog and flaky sautéed fish with pickled chili peppers—confirms the authenticity factor.Skip the Hunan, Mandarin and Cantonese offerings in favor of the Sichuan specialties like dry-fried, bone-in chicken laced with ground chilies and numbing peppercorns. And be sure to order the five-spice hot and spicy pork shoulder. A house specialty, this mouthwatering dish is fork- (or chopstick) tender and rests atop a deliciously piquant chili-oil jus with baby bok choy, scallions and garlic.
"
1151,"It’s easy to overlook pizza as a way to quell hunger pangs, but sink your teeth into the selections here and you’re quickly reminded that it’s an art form unto itself. The pies are, well, epic (and certified by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, one of just a few in the state), and well-seasoned—topped with a zesty tomato sauce and bold ingredients. Then there is that crust—chewy and blistered with just the right amount of char. You could come just for pizza, but that would mean missing out on such delicious dishes as polpo—smoky octopus dressed with anchovy vinaigrette and set atop tomatoes. It’s so much more than just a “salad.”The bustling interior doesn’t distract from the goods. On a nice day, grab a seat on the sidewalk to imbibe the bliss.
"
1152,"For years, Cafe La Haye has been a standby off the square in downtown Sonoma. One bite of its luscious burrata, surrounded by Early Girl tomatoes and crispy squash blossoms in the summer, or vinaigrette-dressed pea shoots in spring, proves it hasn’t aged a day. The small, modern space is still charming, with large windows and lots of mirrors. Stunning local artwork for sale decorates the walls.The food spans cultural influences, including a delicate risotto with pine nuts in a cauliflower broth, or soy-sesame glazed halibut atop whipped potatoes and braised kale. A postage stamp-sized bar pours glasses of Sonoma chardonnay and cabernet, perfect with rich strozzapreti tossed with braised pork ragù, Grana Padano and toasted breadcrumbs.
"
1153,"Opened by a husband-and-wife team just a few doors down from their wine shop (Bay Grape), this alluring spot has that simple yet chic look down pat. Envision a dark green ceiling, brass-and-glass chandeliers, and live plants scattered throughout. The premise is simple—a reasonably priced, three-course dinner and there are no reservations. Choose one of two options for each course—like a soup or salad tailed by pasta and dessert. Items change often, but one constant is the spaghetti, which also served as the inspiration behind this establishment. Presented as a hearty portion, the twirled mound is tossed with Mama's tomato sugo, featuring braised pork and beef. The wine list is full of interesting labels and employs symbols for easier navigation. 
"
1154,"It's a courtyard of bright-painted shipping containers, complete with café lights strung overhead and heat lamps for chilly nights, but this quirky-cute space doles out impressive tacos. The menu is scrawled in chalk on the door of one of the containers, and while it sounds simple—tacos and tostadas—it changes often. Meat, such as the braised pork shoulder topped with an avo-tomatillo salsa and chicharrónes, is a staple; but clever vegan versions, like the charred broccoli with soy-cashew cheese, give proteins a run for their money. Equally ingenious is the smoky baba ghanoush tostada with charred sweet peppers and romano beans.Arrive when doors open to beat the lines and snag a spot at the back. Then go ahead and sip on that beer with a smile. 
"
1155,"The dynamic duo—of Brandi and Janice Dulce—is behind this popular Filipino restaurant that began as a pop-up. Tucked into the Temescal neighborhood, the space may be diminutive but it is ingeniously designed—with whimsical wallpaper and a relaxed, island vibe. Cozy up to the bar while you wait—a situation made infinitely more bearable with a stirring cocktail in hand. The menu is loaded with keepers, but keep your options open for tantalizing specials, like sweet and sour sinigang with pork, eggplant and daikon; or Janice’s Ribs, slow-roasted with coffee, coconut beer and banana ketchup. Suman, a steamed rice cake in a banana leaf, is then served with coconut crumble, coconut sauce and mango for a none-too-sweet treat.Weekends are brunch only. 
"
1156,"Tucked into the stunning Solage Calistoga resort and spa, Solbar is wine country personified—breezy, sunny and serene, with local, farm-fresh food. The whole sense of occasion and relaxation is palpable among every guest here; and for those lucky enough to be seated in the patio, the experience is transcendent.Servers are gracious, attentive and know when to approach or simply let one get on with enjoying this dining room. That sense of regard makes its way into the exquisite food, like tomato tart with an ethereal parmesan mousse. The chef's notable flair is also seen in pan-roasted diver scallops set in a Pacific Coast manila clam broth. For dessert, the flourless cake is one of the best in show—perfectly risen and finished with a Meyer lemon curd.
"
1157,"Chef Mark Liberman may draw his culinary inspiration from some of the greatest kitchens in the world, but rest assured that his food isn't about fireworks. Instead, this kitchen team is focused on the unpretentious charms of great seasonal produce and a well-handled wood grill.Mägo's carte is heavy on casual small plates, such as ratatouille on toasted zucchini bread or crispy soft-shell crab with peaches and plums. And yet, there are fun surprises, too, like the kimchi-style sungold tomatoes that crown a pile of pasta alla chitarra. The nightly “for the table” meat option, like rabbit saddle or grilled tri-tip, is a surefire winner. Save room for such deliciously rustic desserts as corn pudding with blueberries and lime granita.
"
1158,"Burmese food with a California spin is on the menu at Chef/owner Tiyo Shibabaw’s cheery spot in Temescal, where the tea leaf salads come with kale and there’s plenty of flaky, golden roti bread to go around. Everything is affordable here, but the lunchtime specials are an especially good deal: a hot and flavorful entrée (like spicy coconut curry chicken with rice noodles) and a fresh salad—go for the pea shoots topped with radishes and fried garlic in a turmeric dressing.Bright and airy, with exposed wooden beams on the ceiling, Teni draws a crowd of hipsters of all ages. Its dining room can certainly fill up fast at prime hours, but it’s worth the wait for food that’s fresh, flavorful, unfussy and generously portioned.
"
1159,"In addition to its façade, CDP shares a great deal with its sibling, Commis. The name itself is a continuation of classic French kitchen hierarchy nomenclature—the initials stand for Chef de Partie—and it displays the same professional service and elegant cuisine as its counterpart.While Chef Syhabout serves both restaurants, this menu features affordable, snack-sized portions unlike next door. Those seeking a more hearty meal can opt for the côte du boeuf prix-fixe. Begin with canapés like brown butter blinis topped with smoked trout roe or popcorn dressed with dashi seasoning. The signature egg with a slow-poached yolk is poised delicately atop smoked cream, while a Japanese-style cheesecake is more sweet than tangy, with a scoop of strawberry sorbet.
"
1160,"Oakland continues to evolve and maintain its destination status thanks in large part to Commis and its hard-working troupe. This serene elder from Chef/owner James Syhabout is packed every night for its menu of measured and well-conceived dishes.Tucked into colorful Piedmont Avenue, the space is long and neat, with a smattering of tables, cozy banquette seating in the back; and a lively counter overlooking the kitchen. Soft music and a vibrant staff set the mood—cool and contemporary; relaxed but never casual.In the kitchen, Chef Syhabout pairs local ingredients with precise technique; he also pulls from his Thai and Chinese heritage to deliver an elegant menu full of familiar flavors that taste as wonderful as they look. Dinner might unveil silky scallops with crème fraîche, poached asparagus and charred lemon granité. That signature slow-poached egg yolk sitting in a bed of onion- and malt-infused cream is a consistent and thrilling revelation; while white sturgeon caviar with creamed potato and beer-marinated onion resembles an elevated sour cream-and-onion dip. Perfectly cooked mussels set over porridge-like grains is yet another instance of this team's keen vision and laser focus.
"
1161,"In a stretch of Oakland that teems with Ethiopian restaurants, Café Romanat is a standout, thanks to its deliciously spiced dishes served in generous portions. Locals (including some Ethiopian families) fill the small room that is set with traditional low stools, woven tables and features colorful fabric curtains and artwork.Order up a homegrown beer, honey wine or a nutty ground flax or sesame seed juice to pair with the sambusas, triangular pastries stuffed with piquant jalapeño-spiked lentils. All the combination platters, served on spongy, slightly sour injera, are perfect for sharing. And the veggie combo, with dishes like sautéed collard greens, lentils in smoky berbere and split peas with turmeric and ginger, will delight any crowd.
"
1162,"On Shattuck Avenue, this stylish gem from Chef Asuka Uchida brings it with a bang. The building is painted blue with dark tiles along the bottom, silver-framed windows, and a red neon sign. If that doesn't sound on trend, the modern izakaya menu does the trick with a panoply of dishes. It's a modest space, with a shimmering open kitchen, bar featuring floating shelves of bottles, and charcoal is the dominant palette.On the menu, diners are privy to a myriad of staples like hot pot, skewers, rice boxes, and sandos. While the karaage is prize-worthy, the team's skill runs across the board. From tempura to tofu, they are clearly doing something special. To wit: green bean fritters with sansho curry, followed by creamy tofu enriched with ginger and scallion.
"
1163,"The competition may be stiff on Oakland’s Ethiopian restaurant row, but thanks to a warm and welcoming team of chef/owners as well as a menu that excels in weaving together the spices and seasonings, the cuisine at Barcote stands out and sparkles like no other. Whether you opt for a meaty plate of kitfo (spiced minced beef cooked in clarified butter); a sampler of vegetarian stews like spicy misir wot (lentils simmered in berbere sauce); or hearty atakilt wot (cabbage, potato, and carrot stew with turmeric); you’ll be captivated by the layers of flavor.The space is clean and simple, but friendly service and a tree-shaded front patio ensure that it’s homey, not ho-hum. Don’t come in a rush—this is a place to kick back and enjoy a leisurely meal.
"
1164,"This ""lounge"" lets you time travel back to the swinging 60s. The space is comprised of cozy nooks, all meticulously curated with throwback flair, as well as a more traditional dining room upstairs. Note the cool couples in the alcoves, nibbling bites from groovy vintage metal tray tables. Earnest service keeps it all in check. The menu matches the mood; and cocktails, like those punch bowls, figure largely. While nostalgia peppers the carte, familiar-sounding items like broccolini casserole and porcupine meatballs have been reimagined with sparkling results—think lemongrass vinegar and mint aïoli. Can't decide thanks to one-too-many sips of the stirring stuff? Order the ""Dinner Party Menu,"" which leaves you in the hands of this capable kitchen.  
"
1165,"For bold and zesty Mexican food crafted with pristine ingredients, Berkeleyites pack this industrial-chic hot spot, where an excellent cocktail program and an extensive tequila and mezcal selection keep things buzzing. The large flat tortilla griddles for which Comal is named are on full display in the open kitchen, while a covered and heated back patio draws locals for year-round outdoor diningFryer-fresh warm tortilla chips paired with perfect guacamole are irresistible; summon an order as you peruse other options like the refreshing white shrimp ceviche and earthy hen-of-the-woods mushroom quesadilla. Just make sure that those smoky wood-grilled rock cod tacos, with creamy avocado aïoli and spicy cabbage slaw, are on your must-order list.
"
1166,"Can’t swing a ticket to Tokyo? Dinner at Ippuku is the next best thing. With its low Japanese-style tables, extensive woodwork and enormous selection of sake and shochu, it feels like an authentic izakaya transplanted into a corner of downtown Berkeley. The low-profile entrance adds to the feeling that you’ve lucked upon a special dining secret—assuming you don’t stroll right past it, that is.Yakitori is the big draw here, with smoky, salty chicken thighs, necks, hearts and gizzards arriving fresh off the binchotan. Other excellent small plates include korokke, or golden-brown Dungeness crab croquettes, crisp on the outside and with a creamy interior, or yaki-imo, caramelized white sweet potato with a sweet-and-salty glaze.
"
1167,"Chic enough for the style-savvy, cheap enough for students and authentic enough for local Chinese families, Great China is one of the few Berkeley restaurants everyone can (and does) agree on. Spicehounds should look elsewhere, as the food is somewhat mild, but the ingredients are higher quality than the average Chinese spot.Kick things off with an aromatic bowl of hot and sour soup or an order of vegetarian egg rolls. Then sample generously portioned favorites like the sweet-and-spicy kung pao chicken; beautifully lacquered tea-smoked duck; or the beloved “double skin”—a platter of mung bean noodles tossed with pork, mushrooms, squid and a soy-mustard dressing. Only larger parties can reserve, so be aware there may be lines at peak hours.
"
1168,"A legendary address among the foodie set, Alice Waters’ Arts and Crafts bungalow continues to flourish as the Bay Area’s temple of Californian cuisine. The talented team of chefs here work their magic in a gleaming open kitchen that is set at the very back of the dining room and served by an aromatic wood-burning oven.Diners are privy to one nightly fixed menu of four rotating courses (three vegetable-centric on Mondays). It is a matter of chance, but rest assured the dishes will feature peak-season produce—from fresh peas, asparagus and black truffle in a spring risotto, to sweet corn and squash blossoms served with a summer preparation of pork loin.
"
1169,"Thanks to the support of crowd-funding, Nyum Bai started as a pop-up but grew into this cozy, sun-filled local jewel. Inside, pastel colors and wood accents fashion a retro vibe. Outside, find a beer garden of sorts that is filled with picnic tables for soaking in the sunshine while filling up on Cambodian food.Chef/owner Nite Yun puts her signature spin on traditional Khmer dishes that layer tangy, sweet, tart and spicy flavors. Some items are so popular that they might run out early, especially the amok—a fish soufflé made with coconut milk. Others like kuy teav cha, a stir-fry of chewy noodles with tamarind, soy, egg and palm sugar, are sure to satisfy. Finish on a sweet note with nom krouch rolled in palm sugar and presented piping-hot from the fryer.
"
1170,"Pasta aficionados will find paradiso in this petite and casual restaurant-turned-enoteca, set on a busy but bucolic stretch of Rockridge’s main artery. Boasting an impressive passel of regulars who frequently park at the bar to chat with the owner in Italian between bites, Belotti dabbles in the traditional cuisine of Piemonte.Envision such hearty dishes as brasato—braised beef with mushrooms served over polenta and finished with a nebbiolo reduction. House-made pastas are also a major attraction here, including the heirloom grain spaghettini in a tomato sauce with creamy burrata. But more unexpected dishes excel as well: try the delicious butter lettuce salad with lemon and pine nuts, or the decadent tortino, a spinach flan with egg yolk and truffle.
"
1171,"This ""duck house"" is no new kid on the block. In fact, it's been a local fixture for a while now, and this is perhaps in large part due to its well-known Chinese classics. Donning a clean space imbued with splashes of red and gold, wood carvings, and dark wood furniture, there is nothing on the menu that pays particular homage to Beijing. However, the eponymous duck specialty is prepared impeccably and deserves every bit of praise. Presented tableside by a well-suited server, the glistening bird boasts a crisp, fragrant, and succulent skin. It is then carved with unflinching precision and presented with ultra-thin pancakes for wrapping.Vegetables, like Napa cabbage with vinegar, chunky duck sauce, and other accompanying sides complete this decadent meal.
"
1172,"After more than 20 years in San Francisco, this vegan paradise relocated to Oakland, where it’s continuing to put out some of the most unique, delicious plant-based cuisine in the country. This rustic-chic space is laid-back and unfussy, with lots of dark wood, a patio for alfresco dining and a crowd of young families and professionals attended by welcoming servers.While dedicated vegans are sure to swoon, even hardcore carnivores might reconsider the lifestyle after a dose of Chef/owner Eric Tucker’s culinary creativity, showcased best on a five-course “Taste of Millennium” menu. Roasted pumpkin tamales with pumpkin seed pastor and cashew nut crema are knockouts, as are the crunchy king trumpet fritters with chili-persimmon jam.
"
1173,"There’s always a crowd at this neighborhood standby, where friends, families, and chic couples congregate for drinks at the copper-topped bar. Flanked by organic groceries, indie bookstores and antique shops, its environs speak of peace, weaving a bohemian spell that captivates both regulars and rookies alike.Seasonal Californian cooking with an Italian bent dominates this tavern's menu, and a ""butcher block"" of well-prepared charcuterie--like herb-flecked rabbit terrine wrapped in prosciutto--is a prudent way to start your meal. A touch of Calabrian chili adds welcoming heat to the combo of morels, Italian sausage, and sweet corn that sauce a bowl of al dente bucatini. For dessert, warm bread pudding with a coffee-chocolate sauce is utterly devourable.
"
1174,"It may have a reputation for being one of the Bay Area’s most well-regarded restaurants, but Manresa is welcoming, distinctively stylish and extraordinarily hospitable for a fine-dining operation. Chef David Kinch works with some of the region's most revered growers, turning products from Andy's Orchard, Pistils &amp; Petals Farm and Dirty Girl, among others, into works of art.The nightly compositions are unknown until they arrive on the table (a souvenir copy of the menu will be handed to you at the end). The food is at once cerebral and luxurious, approachable and thoroughly delicious. Each course is likely to represent a moment within a season, beginning with savory petit fours that are an illusory play on the palate. Sample red-pepper pâtes de fruits or black olive madeleines along with excellent bread baked at the offshoot bakery made with house-milled flour. Tender striped bass in a saffron bouillabaisse is topped with a crisp wafer of brioche. Even something as simple as asparagus is elevated here with a charred beurre blanc and its fantastic smokiness.Don’t miss those excellent vanilla-bean caramels offered on your way out.
"
1175,"Dio Deka may specialize in Greek food, but this is no typical taverna, as the stylish dining room (complete with a roaring fireplace) ably demonstrates. A wealthy, well-dressed Los Gatos crowd flocks to the front patio on warm evenings, dining and people-watching within the vine-covered walls of the Hotel Los Gatos. The bar also draws a brace of cheery regulars.Skip the dull mesquite-grilled steaks and keep your order Greek: think stuffed grape leaves with tender braised beef cheek, or a bright pan-seared local salmon with roasted yellow peppers, potatoes and artichokes. The adventurous shouldn’t miss out on the fun offering of Greek wines, and sweet buffs should allow space for the crema me meli, a fantastic burnt-honey mousse with almond and lemon.
"
1176,"This Oakland institution is widely hailed as the temple of tacos. It is strictly no fuss—no air-conditioning—and no service–order at the counter—but after one bite of their juicy meat, dripping with so much savory goodness that the yellow corn tortillas are doubled up, and it's all worth it. Meat is given the star treatment here, and offal, including tripe and cabeza, are of special note. The suadero, a beef-based, carnitas-style taco, and the seared, crumbled chorizo taco with a distinct smoky flavor, exceed expectations. Good things come in threes, so order another—tender and flavorful carnitas is a sure thing. There is a wide selection of aguas frescas ranging from guava and passion fruit to carrot, or go for the old standby—Mexican Coca-Cola.  
"
1177,"If dining at Manresa is like a weeklong stay at a luxury resort, this New Orleans-inspired love letter from Chef/owner David Kinch (to the city where he first learned to cook) is a weekend party in the Big Easy. With its zinc bar, pressed ceilings, and open kitchen stacked with bottles of hot sauce, it might just fool you into thinking you’re in the heart of Louisiana—right down to the zydeco and jazz tunes on the stereo.This is a spot so beloved that locals (some even with kids in tow) know to arrive early to sample the special and spicy andouille-flecked gumbo z’herbes; oyster po’boys with white chile sauce; golden-brown hushpuppies; and other Cajun and Creole classics. Dessert pundits will delight in the rich and aromatic chocolate-pecan chess pie.
"
1178,"ASA South is like your good looking friend, who also just so happens to be the perfect dining companion. The space is plain likable, featuring a chic dining room set with sleek furnishings, silver bark-like wallpaper and black-and-white photos. And then there's the kitchen, which doesn't take itself too seriously and manages to infuse a bit of fun into its repertoire of serious food. Case in point? The signature rigatoni with mushrooms, described as having too many ingredients to list. But, rest assured as they do a bang-up job. There's something for everyone on this wide-reaching carte, especially if you're a lover of fish—sustainably harvested, of course.The horseshoe-shaped bar out front is an ideal perch for a sip or solo meal. 
"
1179,"For a down-home (but still Napa-chic) alternative to the Cal-Ital wine country grind, follow your nose to this Long Meadow Ranch-owned farmhouse, whose intoxicating smoker is parked right in the front yard. The cathedral ceiling, old-school country music and boisterous locals give Farmstead a permanent buzz; for quieter dining, hit the front terrace.Dishes are laden with ranch-grown products utilized in outstanding preparations like a summery salad of heirloom tomatoes and creamy burrata with salsa verde. The bone-in heritage porkchop with apple chutney on a bed of creamy jalapeno grits and grilled broccolini is spot-on. Take the farm-fresh flavor with you—on weekends the restaurant's stands are brimming with produce, beef and honey for purchase. 
"
1180,"Christopher Kostow’s casual-cool retreat continues to be a well-regarded and rightly applauded Napa mainstay. With soaring ceilings and a hulking hearth, the beautifully restored dining room is an apposite setting for the chef's California cooking.Much of the featured produce comes from their own farm, and a whole bounty is on full display in a simple bowl of just-plucked veggies, best matched with a fermented soy dip. Kurobuta pork ribs; chicken with preserved lemon; sweet potato with brown butter and herbs—nearly everything from mains to sides bears traces of the flames and are best enjoyed as a group. A recent starter of aged Wagyu beef tartare with ember mayo and milk bread may just be one of the finest versions we’ve seen yet.
"
1181,"A stone’s throw from the 580 but seemingly a world apart, this handsome locale—ensconced in the arbored suburban quietude of San Leandro—offers a uniquely pleasurable experience. Husband-and-wife co-owners Matthew Beavers and DanVy Vu opted to honor this fixture’s former life as a family-owned hat shop by keeping the name—and the well-crafted cocktails are also dubbed with nods to millinery.Chef Vu leads the kitchen, and her skillful contemporary combination of Vietnamese and Californian flavors is tantalizing. Crunchy seared rice cakes come packed with savory goodness, and meltingly tender braised oxtail over creamy grits have unusual depth. For a pillow-soft landing, finish with the signature lemon-ricotta zeppole, offered with a trio of luscious sauces.
"
1182,"This modern American dining room exudes all the wine country vibes, where the G&amp;Ts are designed to specifications and the dry-aged USDA Prime steaks hold equal standing with lighter, more contemporary fare. If that's not enough, they also boast the largest collection of Napa wines in the world. Indulgence is the name of the game in the kitchen as well.With a bucolic location off Highway 29, Press features cozy dark wood, booths, a fireplace, and lofty ceilings. The well-to-do crowd marvels at the decorative ceramic clock sourced from a bygone NY train station, all the while sipping on full-bodied reds that pair perfectly with the interesting items.
"
1183,"Jeffrey Stout has clearly settled in to his position at the helm of this international gem, packed with a crowd of loyal fans, despite its rather modest shopping-center locale. Polished yet casual with a large front bar and patio, a meal here is best enjoyed with a group—so come prepared to max out the menu.Dishes may spin in various directions, but this team won't steer your wrong. Kick off with a cocktail; then tuck into fresh hamachi enriched with avocado-dill purée, persimmon, and deliciously tart sunomono. Garnished with peanuts and served with chili oil, those delicate shrimp-and-pork dumplings are an evergreen hit. For dessert, olive oil cake with lime-brittle popcorn and roasted corn custard delivers a pleasing contrast in flavor and texture.
"
1184,"From the symphonic blend of top-quality flavors in the kitchen to the brightly hued dining room walls decked with Aztec-inspired figures, this family-run spot delivers a taste of Mexico City. The two brothers behind this operation, which started as a wildly popular food truck, present delicacies like huaraches and quesadilla de huitlacoche that rarely appear on other menus in town. Here, quesadillas are made from house-made tortillas, so try the one filled with squash blossom, queso fresco and tomatillo salsa. Tortas are a draw at lunch, while the pambazo—with bread dipped in guajillo sauce and then seared—is divine at all times.The $2 tacos featuring tender suadero and al pastor are a delightful surprise, not unlike their selection of agua frescas. 
"
1185,"At this iconic roadhouse, it’s a joy to eat your greens—imagine freshly plucked lettuces from the bountiful garden boxes. In fact, Chef Pawlcyn is a wine country pioneer for incorporating on-site gardens that produce ingredients routinely seen on this seasonal menu. The fish of the day may unveil grilled halibut sauced with oxtail reduction and plated with silken leeks and fingerling potatoes. But, save room as this is not the place to skip dessert; and the lemon-lime tart capped with brown sugar meringue fittingly described on the menu as “ridiculously tall” doesn’t disappoint.It should come as no surprise that there’s usually a wait for a table here. But use the time to take a stroll on the lush grounds for a preview of what the kitchen has in store.
"
1186,"This is one of the first restaurants to elevate the Napa Valley to greatness. For over a decade, Chef Robert Curry has been ensuring its legacy with cooking that is the very definition of Californian cuisine: global flavors expressed through local and seasonal ingredients. The kitchen’s work is as impressive as the setting, although it is during brunch or lunch when the creations truly come to life. Everything seems more beautiful from this extraordinary perch, overlooking the vineyards and mountains. Those terrace tables have some of the best views around.The chef's tasting menu invites guests to control how their experience unfolds by choosing dishes. Begin with an elegant soup of sweet white corn soup poured tableside. Layered with bay shrimp and a cube of toasted brioche topped with tarragon crème fraîche, it is rich and creamy. Dishes continue to dazzle all the way through to dessert, where a stunning fig plate, complete with lemon gelée and fig leaf gelato, is an absolute delight. Servers are stylish, polite and manage to refill your glass after each sip, without seeming intrusive. Their wine list is one of the most notable in the valley and proudly showcases local growers.
"
1187,"Chef Nick Tamburo had big shoes to fill following the closure of longtime favorite, Redd Wood, but he’s made it look effortless. This space is as happening and easy-breezy as everyone remembers, with an open kitchen framed by white subway tiles, high ceilings, and a curing room filled with rows and rows of dry-aged ducks.While waiting 45-minutes for the signature entrée, start with thin slivers of kampachi garnished with preserved perilla or swipe large corn and nori fritters through a cloud-like mousse of corn studded with trout roe. Wood-fired pizzas are a nod to the previous tenant. And for dessert, the dangerously comforting burnt cheesecake is a must, arriving with a top as black as the night and a center that's as airy and delicate as ever.
"
1188,"A pleasant contrast to the sleek new spots around town, this dining room's country-style curtains and front porch are a ticket to another era—and a hot ticket at that, since tables are hard to come by. Indeed, this Yountville gem could pass off as a John Wayne film set, with its wood-framed, 1916-era grocery look. But for sure, Ciccio is more of a spaghetti Western, thanks to a selection of crave-worthy pizzas cooked in a wood-burning oven. Spicy mortadella, cherry peppers, and creamy fontina will always be a favorite, not unlike a recent white pie, featuring leeks, green garlic, thyme, and fried lemon.Be on the lookout for house-made pasta specials, like ricotta dumplings. Set in a veal-and-pork Sunday sauce, you'll be back—likely next week—for more.
"
1189,"Chef/owner Jo Lerma-Lopez’s love for food is clear in every morsel that emerges from this kitchen. The name, which means “moon” in Spanish, is also used as an acronym to reflect the team's ethos of “L(local) U(unrefined) N(natural) A(authentic)” cooking. Dishes are decidedly highbrow, thanks to such special ingredients as Rancho Gordo beans, Mary’s free-range chicken, and everything else made from scratch—chorizo, chicken stock, and sauces galore. Pescatarians revel in coctel de camarones and cod ceviche; while chile relleno picadillo has carnivores returning for more.The vibrant cantina flaunts a full-service bar and open-air patio. Having earned its stripes as a neighborhood darling, it's no wonder that a second sibling is in full swing in Campbell.
"
1190,"While it may be set smack dab in the midst of quaint Yountville, Thomas Keller's take on the lively French bistro paints a scene that may as well be straight out of Paris. Picture red velvet booths, marble tables, polished brass, and that iconic tiled floor. Then throw in a buzzy scene dominated by bon vivants, a next-door bakery that ensures bread here reigns supreme, and the result is spot on.The kitchen keeps the mood upbeat thanks to a litany of well-crafted plates. Start by slathering butter onto a hunk of pain d'epi, before moving on to crispy roasted chicken over corn with bacon lardons and oyster mushrooms. Seasonal bites, like the rustic tomato, are worth a second look; while desserts like a lemon tart exude all things luxe.
"
1191,"It’s not uncommon for first-timers here to find themselves waiting at this front bar flanked by flat-screen TVs. The rowdy crowd, hustling bartenders, and a packed room may suggest that this is just another after-work spot, but how wrong an assumption that would be, largely as this Mexican gem arrives courtesy of famed Chef Thomas Keller.Driving the stoves here is Chef de Cuisine Kaelin Ulrich Trilling, whose Oaxacan roots are on full display.While his menu highlights such impeccably sourced items as stone-ground tortillas, yellowfin tuna aguachile, and tres leches cake, it is the mole negro—a complex blend of dried fruits, nuts and bittersweet chocolate—that is an absolute showstopper, accurately reflecting the chef's heritage.
"
1192,"If you’ve ever wondered how Thomas Keller cooks at home, Ad Hoc is your best bet. The most casual of Chef Keller’s restaurants, it offers accessible fare served family style in a bright and inviting wood-paneled room. Waits are inevitable without a reservation, but the engaging staff keep things hopping. The dining room feels like a country home, with that iconic blue awning and a sign that reads “for temporary relief from hunger.""The food is worth the wait and while dishes may sound simple, the crafting is not—come every other Monday for the outstanding fried chicken. A salad of sautéed red bliss potatoes tossed in Sriracha aïoli is beyond par; and even the humble cheese course dazzles. Generous portions may warrant sharing chocolate mousse for dessert.
"
1193,"Around the world in four courses without ever leaving the wine country? It’s possible at this bright and beloved downtown Napa space that balances fun with excellence. Only here can a top-notch tamale filled with chipotle-pulled pork, green chile and black beans be followed by cassoulet that would do any Frenchman proud—thanks to its decadent mélange of butter beans, duck confit and two kinds of sausage.With Italian and American staples in the mix as well, it might sound too eclectic for one meal, but Grace’s Table earns its name with charming service and a thoughtful, well-priced wine list to bridge any gaps between cuisines. Regardless, make sure you don't miss the satiny, ganache-layered devil’s food chocolate cake—a slice is big enough to split.
"
1194,"This cool wine bar clearly takes pride in the mastery of its sommelier by pouring a lengthy and thoughtful array of wines from the world over. At the same time, Compline serves a focused menu of appealingly hearty food that pairs well with this list. Find a perch at the bar so you can chat with the staff about their vast selection, but tables in the dining room or patio are just as pleasant.Savor a glass of champagne with duck fat fries—to whet the appetite—before perusing the menu. Juicy half-pound burgers on brioche are a great way to get going here, especially when layered with Gruyère and mushrooms. Less casual items feature a Liberty Farms duck breast or rustic hanger steak.Keep an eye on the calendar for themed tasting events and seminars.
"
1195,"Enter through a metal gate to land upon this charming patio, virtually beaming with lights and greenery. The dining room is quaint, with a sleek bar, exposed brick, and large tile floors. The décor is simple and clean, but a set of sparkling chandeliers add that elegance factor. The staff are a smooth, efficient bunch; and the bistro menu from Chef/owner Paul Magu-Lecugy spans the classics. Think light house-made gougères and wild boar pâté, to a more hearty plate of noisettes de chevreuil poélées (venison stuffed in puff pastry over celery root purée). The lemon meringue tart is always a sublime way to cap off the feast.A predominantly French wine list goes well beyond just Boudreaux and Burgundy—and even throws in a bit of California for good measure.
"
1196,"If powerful flavors make you tick, then this hideout is just for you. Nestled within an ordinary mall, it almost feels like a secret that doesn't wish to be found. But, make your way inside to discover an attractive space, donning cultural artifacts and intricate wood details. Pleather banquettes lend a soft feel, while burgundy hues feel more bold and beautiful. The menu offers a range of ambitious dishes, so indulge in the likes of fried beef trip and leeks, followed by sautéed pork with star anise, cumin, and dried green beans. The acid from the fermented greens cuts through the richness of the fatty pork to deliver just the right balance of flavor.Diners should ask about the famous bobo chicken—it's an elusive treat and veritable feast for the senses.
"
1197,"Adega is Portuguese for “wine cellar,” and following suit, this exquisite dining room stocks over 200 vintages that are rarely seen on these Western shores. But that’s just the beginning for the team of David Costa and Pasty Chef Jessica Carreira, who elevate every course on this appetizing menu with a perfect blend of pristine local produce and top-notch, imported ingredients.Seafood is a particular area of focus in this kitchen, and diners shouldn't miss the likes of a dressed-up take on Portugal's culinary backbone—that is, bacalhau, or salted cod. In this rendition, it is moist and flavorful, arranged over crisp potatoes, nubs of black olives, and a creamy cod sauce. Succulent carabineros (deep-sea scarlet-tinted prawns) are marinated in lemongrass and seaweed, before being topped with a briny contrast of caviar. And even those skeptical of blood sausage may well be converted by the outstanding morcela, which is wrapped in a pastry shell and served with a refreshing apple-celery sauce.Chef Carreira’s desserts are equally notable—and delightful. Sample, for instance, the soft and quivering flan, layered with caramelized sugar and gilded with a quenelle of vanilla ice cream. 
"
1198,"Vallejo isn’t the first place that springs to mind when you think elevated cuisine, but a seat at this reputed dining counter will have you feeling like you stepped into an episode of Chef’s Table. The space itself is simple and intimate, furnished with a handful of tables and seven seats overlooking the kitchen, so book your spot in advance. It’s a laid-back scene, where the focus remains squarely on the food.Chef Warring, who hails from Napa's esteemed Auberge du Soleil, spins his well-honed skill and technique on pristine seasonal products, and the results are enticing. Think of ocean trout crudo with shaved hearts of palm and kohlrabi microgreens; or perfectly seared sous vide ribeye with sautéed maitake mushrooms.
"
1199,"Many a warm evening has been spent on the garden patio of this fantastic Thai restaurant, where potted plants create a leafy retreat. Whether you’re dining alfresco or tucked inside the tiny, colorful bungalow, you can be assured of a warm welcome and boldly flavorful food—a secret that’s out with the locals, making this house a packed one from noon to night.The consistently outstanding menu makes it hard for one to go wrong, but you can’t miss with the creamy red pumpkin curry, full of tender scallops, prawns and perfectly balanced notes of sweet, spicy, salty and sour. Other showstoppers may reveal pad prik king, chicken in a spicy peanut-tamarind sauce or the aromatic basil tofu, jam-packed with fresh vegetables, chili and garlic.
"
1200,"This far-from-sterile space might even be described as dramatic, given its arched wood panels, dark charcoal tiles, soft pendant lights, and back-lit wall of wine. A ladder running across completes the effect. Mustard-yellow booths invite diners to the center of the room, where the staff may bestow upon them sustainably focused fare as well as their own product knowledge Francis X. Hogan is the chef/partner and his compositions are contemporary Californian. Menus dance to the seasons, unveiling such passionate and ingenious dishes as a spring garlic velouté with Livermore olive oil, and half a head of za'atar-roasted romanesco with green tahini and pine nuts. An Irish take on coffee and donuts is executed perfectly and will leave you wanting for more.
"
1201,"Happily set in the Justin Winery, this Californian-centric haven is a celebration of the seasons and abundant local ingredients. Make your way through long, winding roads to land upon the lush retreat. Understated and elegant, this space is furnished with a tasting counter and tables just beyond. The muted décor allows diners to focus on the food—and (rolling vineyard) view. Lunch is dialed back, but the menu truly shines at night, when the kitchen team flexes its creative skills to churn out deliciously complementary items. Imagine asparagus with a soft quail egg, blood orange, and duck prosciutto or artichoke tortellini with truffle and peas.As expected, theirs is an impressive wine list, replete with their own labels among other unique selections.
"
1202,"This charmer from husband-and-wife team, Bill and Sarah Niles, may look straight out of a trendy, urban neighborhood, but instead calls Livermore home. The rustic interior with big arched windows and plenty of succulents screams ""hipster hotspot."" However, few big-city restaurants can offer such an enthusiastic, passionate staff and friendly local crowd.Sip on a St. James Sour and tuck into appealing bites like fig toast with a drizzle of olive oil and salt; delicately fried yellow squash and green tomatoes over toasted pumpkin seeds and basil aïoli; or cod over tender flageolet beans with roasted nardello peppers and a cherry tomato relish. Finish with malted milk ice cream topped with flaky sea salt, honeycomb sugar candy and savory olive oil.
"
1203,"Chef Ryan Fancher's modern steakhouse is on the grounds of Hotel San Luis Obispo, in a separate building connected by a walkway. The hotel's contemporary Southwest vibe lives on in the restaurant. Design details, like butterscotch leather banquettes, a stacked brick wall divider, and teal-blue tiles, enhance the X factor. Staff are well-informed, so let them steer you through the menu. Start with such comfort fare as savory goat cheese croquettes with sweet lavender honey before embarking on the main event—charred steaks and sides of creamed spinach topped with onion rings.On the same property and from the same chef, Piadina is worth a visit—for its Cal-Ital menu and that hotel classic club sandwich turned on its head with fried chicken and B&amp;B pickles.
"
1204,"What Ricky Odbert originally started in his parents garage has evolved into a fine-dining bijou. Tucked amidst the many Tin City Paso Robles buildings, look for the sign that says ""SIX"" and you'll know you've arrived. Small and gleaming, the décor is comprised of a stunning wood counter facing a pristine kitchen. Dark floors, charcoal-tinted walls, and pendant lights augment the warm and inviting vibe.A multiple-course tasting menu is on the books, evolving with and inspired by the seasons of the Central Coast. Fridays and Saturdays feature an expanded menu, with dishes that highlight the chef's unique style and creative vision. Diners will be riveted from start to finish—silky chicken liver mousse with shallot-onion jam and arugula; tailed by crisp-skinned duck with bay leaf-laced jus and pickled beets speak to the team's focused yet complex flavor unions. Desserts, like honey ice cream with cherry blossom syrup and fennel pollen or a mushroom-shaped tuile with a dot of porcini and dark chocolate, depict a delicate blend of sweet and savory elements.A highly selective wine list brings small producers under the spotlight. Alternatively, bring your own from the wineries nearby.
"
1205,"This invitingly rustic dining room is nestled within a historic structure—a former bank—with a blue door flanked by potted palms. Inside, the furnishings exude a vintage vibe, as evidenced by weathered tile floors, whitewashed brick walls, and metal signs. An open window offers a peek into the kitchen, buzzing with casually dressed but attentive servers.After cutting their teeth at top NYC kitchens, Daisy and Greg Ryan set sail for the west coast—settling into the confines of the Santa Ynez Valley. Dubbed as ""Franch"" (French with Californian accents), their particular skill lies in blending phenomenal product with focused flavors and methods. This is cooking that tastes as good as it looks, shining a spotlight on local purveyors. Naturally, crowds keep coming for their unpretentious dishes. Wild snails drip with luscious garlic and parsley butter, while the Santa Barbara uni crêpe cake is layered with crème fraîche and caviar. Lamb en croûte may be next, served over Calabrian chili aïoli with asparagus. The meat is tender and the aïoli perfectly cuts through the rich, savory elements.Desserts are equally worthy—from a buttery gâteau Breton to black pepper cookies laced with dark chocolate. 
"
1206,"In a small, romantic boutique hotel, this is a deliciously old-school restaurant that is coming into its own with ambitious cuisine. This should be no surprise, as the chef boasts a background in some esteemed and globally acclaimed kitchens.Guests are invited to create their own prix-fixe menu by selecting four to five dishes from a variety of categories, such as garden, ocean or farm. This might yield a meal that begins with a refreshing gazpacho made from delicately spiced melon with basil blossom and a bit of smoky fried shrimp. Masterful desserts have included a brown-butter sponge cake with dense clotted cream and marinated strawberries.Be sure to sample the owner’s own wine label, Coqueliquot, available in a range of styles.
"
1207,"Don’t let the less-than-swanky location fool you into thinking that this is anything less than an excellent vegan restaurant. Besides, once inside it feels more like a house with a lovely garden terrace, wood décor and wide-open kitchen. This is the kind of food that even meat-eaters can instantly love.From the first bite of a mushroom umami burger with crisp lettuce and superb heirloom tomatoes, it is abundantly clear that these ingredients arrive fresh from the farm. Be sure to sample their Latin-style dishes like gluten-free picadillos tacos or empanadas. Polenta fries with jalapeños and caramelized onions are a hands-down favorite; while the sweet cashew cheesecake decked out with strawberries and an almond crust is a signature for good reason.
"
1208,"The Santa Barbara Public Market is full of alluring eateries, but after your first taste of this charming taco stand, you’ll want to pledge your heart. Chef/owner Ramon Velazquez mastered the craft of handmade tortillas and zesty salsas at the feet of his Guadalajaran mother and grandmother, but he also has a few tricks of his own that often involve additions of delightfully unique local produce.Standouts include a cheesy, griddled taco piled with grilled octopus, white shrimp and avocado, as well as a veggie-packed Oaxaca cheese quesadilla bursting at the seams with confit tomatoes, broccolini, and radishes. After ordering at the counter, be sure to hit the impressive salsa bar, stocked with a half-dozen homemade concoctions for ad-hoc accessorizing. 
"
1209,"This eatery in the heart of downtown is not only good fun but also good for the wallet. Here, the Chefs/partners bring their disparate expertise—one is a barbecue aficionado from Nashville, the other is Indonesian, and together they turn out a menu of thoroughly pleasing Southeast Asian food. Attractions include a well-spiced rendition of green papaya salad, mixing aromatic herbs, chilies and peanuts. Bao can be ordered fried or steamed, which yields a pillowy soft bun to be filled with crunchy fried chicken in a tangy sauce.The interior is appealingly simple, but the back patio is a hidden gem, filled with string lights and communal tables that can be booked for parties. Weekday happy hour simply means steep discounts on a variety of food and drinks.
"
1210,"This quaint little house run by a husband-wife team just happens to be one of the area's favorite spots for traditional Japanese dining. This should be no surprise, as Chef Yoichi Kawabata’s background includes cooking at Nobu Tokyo. The dining room is quiet and serene, filled with white walls and dark wood tables—there is no sushi counter. Service is both friendly and informative.The seven-course menu respects all the rules of kaiseki dining, using top seasonal ingredients and pristine, top-class fish. Meals begin with an array of four appetizers (zenzai) including delectable Wagyu beef that has been grilled and glazed in a sansho pepper sauce. Then grilled duck breast may be prepared with perfect tenderness in sweet soy sauce with green peppers.
"
1211,"With their name emblazoned in pink, this trendy Indian from co-owners Alejandro Medina and noted sommelier Rajat Parr makes quite the splash. Inside, the space is small but well appointed, with vaulted ceilings and chandeliers; the patio outside is a verdant, summertime delight. Harnessing the best of land and sea, these dishes are born for sharing. Behold such inventive bites as crispy cauliflower tossed with chili-garlic sauce and finished with sesame. Barra kebab highlights intensely spiced tandoor lamb chops with mint chutney; while vegetables like baingan bharta (eggplant with ginger) are a heady treat. The cooking is strong and flavors well executed. No wonder, dessert is an afterthought.A list of natural wines merely augments the focused carte.
"
1212,"This off-the-beaten-path favorite is inspired by California coastal traditions. Set just steps from downtown Santa Barbara, excellent sourcing and quality ingredients may as well as be the kitchen's mission.The outdoor smoker and grill are enough to lure folks over to their covered patio or casually cool dining room. Start with a local craft beer or wine to accompany any one of their diverse small plates, which are generally centered around the grill. Highlighting their farm-to-table ethos and a love of all things organic is a pulled pork sandwich, with meat that's deliciously tender on the inside yet perfectly crunchy on the out. Standbys like pinquito beans are fulfilling—not unlike a scoop of the pomegranate- tamarind- and blood orange-ice cream.
"
1213,"Loquita is located just blocks from the beach and inside a cream-tinted building with a red-tiled roof. Small and stylish, the space oozes with creative flair—picture colorful tiles, a humming bar framed by soft pink stools, and starburst light fixtures. Find a perch at the beloved wood counter or outside in the inviting and attractive patio. Servers know the menu by heart, so follow their lead and start with tapas like crusty pan con tomate, before digging into hearty chorizo y pollo paella. An homage to the El Bullí olive is a contemporary signature, while carpaccio garnished with pickled mustard seeds and aged sherry vinegar is fittingly popular.A separate gin and tonic list, complete with iterations of the classic, makes a great kickoff (and sendoff).
"
1214,"Located at the waterfront Hotel Californian, Blackbird is as attractive as its surroundings. Inside, its décor blends art deco and mid-century styles, with an “air kiss” to the private clubs of yesteryear. Striking arched doors seem to let the sea breeze wash over the room and an inviting bar runs the length of the space with plenty of creative cocktails.The kitchen keeps the nearby Pacific in mind with first courses like Dungeness crab puffs with Manchego cheese and Urfa pepper-spiked honey. Spaghetti with local sea urchin, Calabrese pepper and smoked seaweed, or a whole roasted branzino with ramps, beets and grilled onion jam keep the theme going. Expect a creative finish, including at least one multicourse dessert option.  
"
1215,"This former fish market is located in the Funk Zone arts district, just a stone’s throw from the oceanfront. The vibrant dining room has become one of the trendiest places in town, largely thanks to the urban scene it fashions through an edgy décor and vintage lighting. Service remains cool and laid-back as ever, while also taking very good care of each guest.Meals are served as large, family-style portions that are meant to be shared and spotlight the central coast’s finest ingredients. Well-mastered original creations may unveil blistered shishito peppers and roasted eggplant with cilantro yogurt, sweet and sour pickles as well as duck-fat breadcrumbs.The wine selection is a smart representation of the best of Santa Barbara’s producers.

1216,"Serving generous portions of hearty south-of-the-border favorites by way of California, along with a relaxed, family-friendly vibe, this place deserves every bit of praise lavished upon it. The staff may bring chips immediately to your table, but salsa and drinks are both self-service. Remember to order at the counter and collect a number before taking a seat. Start with the likes of lime-marinated halibut ceviche tostada with cilantro and avocado. Then pick from a variety of sizeable burritos or go for the satisfyingly cheesy and crispy costra taco al pastor, with pineapple, marinated pork, and chipotle—enlivened with pickled onions.There may be four locations, but this one is the original. The room can get crowded, so takeaway is a popular option.
"
1217,"After making a match at NYC’s Roberta’s, Brendan Smith and Rachel Greenspan took their pizza-powered love affair to the west coast, leaving bohemian Brooklyn for a gleaming perch in the Montecito Country Mart. Each night, the pair dishes up a dozen pie varieties tattooed with the delicate char of their wood-fired oven. Standouts include the carbonara with pancetta, egg and pecorino, or even a summery peach number with fontina, poblano, and red onions.For those strong enough to resist pizza, other notable items include fried eggplant with harissa-spiked marinara and shrimp scampi over saffron risotto. This oven also does a solid sideline in baked goods, so grab some brown-butter chocolate chip cookies or a crusty sourdough loaf on your way out. 
"
1218,"Though it’s right by the tony Montecito Inn, this eatery from Chefs/owners Phillip Frankland Lee and Margarita Kallas-Lee is no ordinary omakase spot. The nigiri are not just supremely finessed but also infused with original touches—like the dab of sweet corn “pudding” and sourdough breadcrumbs that coat slices of hamachi. Even traditional pairings become transcendent with his house-fermented soy sauce.The iconoclastic vibe extends to the beverages, including cocktails, sake, and beer. Despite such originality, this ""bar"" does indeed adhere strictly to one tradition: a mini counter with seating for just ten to ensure a deeply personalized experience. Your time here is bound to pass in a blissful haze of convivial chatter.
"
1219,"This mini izakaya greets guests with a mouthwatering whiff of smoky meat at the door, while also honoring its cool surrounds. Imagine a farm-to-table menu and flats of microgreens growing on the bar.Head straight to that counter for a front-row seat with views of the charcoal grill. There, Chef/owner Craig Takehara is prepping and grilling juicy hot bites that arrive straight from the binchotan. These skewered meats include highlights like negima (chicken thighs and green onion), as well as a beautifully charred Kurobuta pork jowl perfect with just a squeeze of lemon and salt. The menu goes on to list small plates, rice dishes and noodles, such as chewy sukiyaki udon in gingery-soy sauce with thinly sliced ribeye and an abundance of those microgreens.
"
1220,"Downtown Sacramento meets sexy uptown London at this foodie haven, where Chef Oliver Ridgeway applies his formidable British culinary know-how to farm-fresh Californian ingredients. Inside, the striking dining room features glossy floor-to-ceiling windows; a polished, forever-bustling bar; as well as a lovely outdoor dining area overlooking Capitol Mall.As the name informs, spit-roasted meats take center stage here. A decadent evening feast might begin with an airy popover before settling into more substantial dishes. Don’t miss the incredibly tender prime rib, paired with crispy golden potato rösti, fermented horseradish, sour cream and peppery watercress. Classic English desserts, like the scrumptious Banoffee pie, are perfect for sharing.
"
1221,"Celebrated as the “third house” because of its popularity among politicians making deals in the back booths, this venerable Chinese-American jewel has been family owned since 1939. Step inside and you'll be transported into another era by way of a retro bar serving up happy-hour martinis and an elegant dining room attended to by tie-wearing servers and festooned with valuable relics.The menu is as much of a throwback as the décor, with yu kwok (crispy beef, pork and water chestnut dumplings) sharing equal billing with not-so-Chinese items, including banana cream pie. But don’t be dissuaded by the seeming inauthenticity as everything is beautifully executed, from the fried chicken marinated with brandy and ginger to addictive garlic-chili green beans.
"
1222,"The Citizen Hotel is primo for those with business on their minds, but that doesn’t mean it’s all just corporate here downtown. In fact, Grange, tucked inside the hotel, is proof positive that business and pleasure mix with fine results. High ceilings and an arched shelf stacked with liquor instantly draw the eye, while wood tables lined with orange leather banquettes balance style and comfort. If visiting midday, opt for the Power Lunch and enjoy three courses for a palatable price.The menu shares a farm-focused sensibility with rustic creations. Mojo pork loin spread with calabrese bomba on toasted bread is simple and tasty, not unlike the dependably creamy broccoli-arugula soup. Hazelnut cake with strawberry and chocolate ends things on a sweet note.
"
1223,"The Rosewood Miramar Beach is its home and contemporary Californian food with Italian leanings is the kitchen's dictum. Housed in a separate structure and set back on the water, make the small walk to arrive at this elegant retreat. The dining room is beautifully attired with leather booths, linen-robed tables, and white chairs, all of which afford views of the crashing waves. But make no mistake, the seasonal prix-fixe takes center stage. A chilled minted pea soup with pickled fennel makes for a rich kick off, and may be tailed by gnocchetti Sardi mingled with dulse, uni, and caviar for zest and decadence.Have a case of the Mondays? Go for the Johnnie Walker Blue-laced budino and take in the view—it's just that sort of special-occasion haven.
"
1224,"This upscale beaut in downtown Sacramento is equal parts rustic and refined, with floor-to-ceiling curtains, thick linens and a colorful overhang comprised of antique wood. You’re likely to be seated among regulars, who can be found chatting with the attentive staff and sampling their wine pairing suggestions (there are plenty of half-glass options for the lunchtime Capitol crowd). The menu offers creative takes on global dishes, including a salad of vine-ripened, handpicked, heirloom tomatoes with shaved radish, avocado purée, and a dill dressing enriched with ricotta salata. Perfectly crispy Southern fried chicken is a staple and rightfully so.The bar is a great place to linger—with an expertly prepared cocktail, like the house gin and tonic.
"
1225,"With its good looks and regal food, this bright haunt is already a hot spot. Its hip, industrial-chic interior is modern and plain gorgeous, with hanging green plants, white painted pipes and exposed brick. Incredibly fresh, creative Californian fare reigns supreme on this menu, and the dishes turned out are well-balanced and neatly executed. Try the delicate pickled fritto misto, a crispy tempura mix of rotating, seasonal vegetables (think sweet potatoes, okra, or cauliflower) paired with a vibrant pink beet “aïoli” made from aquafaba. Another crowd favorite is the juicy half chicken from the hearth, served with zucchini purée, roasted baby squash and basil oil.The Tobacco Road, infused with white oak smoke, is their updated take on the Old Fashioned.
"
1226,"Together with his tight-knit team, Chef/owner Christopher Barnum-Dann brings unusual warmth to this intimate setting. His enthusiasm is instantly palpable as he happily explains his inspiration behind particular dishes and even solicits feedback. This is especially true for diners who sit at the spacious counter.The cooking has a clean, modern simplicity, and its commitment to carefully sourced ingredients is thoroughly Californian. However, it also offers no shortage of personality, combining flavors while also drawing from various global cuisines. Whimsy is a common thread throughout one's meal, as in an ""artist's palette"" of duck liver mousse offered with an array of ""paints"" made up of flavorful preserves and purées to be mixed and matched as you eat.
"
1227,"Set right in the Capitol Mall, this upscale stunner (which also has outposts in University Village and Roseville) dons an elegant demeanor by way of heavy wooden doors, dark metal chandeliers and plenty of lush greenery. The sprawling outdoor patio boasts terrific people-watching. And though it’s named for Mexico City’s central plaza, this kitchen's menu offers regional highlights from around the country.Puebla-style chicken enchiladas, for instance, smothered in handmade mole poblano burst with flavor, while crispy tostadas contrast rich Michoacan-style carnitas against a zesty and bright salsa. Tequila nerds will thrill to the extensive selection, but there’s no shame in just ordering a margarita—the “Mango Fresco” with a tajín salt rim is a winner.
"
1228,"A firehouse in its previous life, this Sacramento gem features food that will have you returning time and again, but sentimentalists beware, as the menu changes daily. While you can’t be sure what’s on offer here, fresh, seasonal and satisfying cooking is a guarantee. Imagine the likes of  tortellini stuffed with winter squash, followed by a “beggar’s purse” filled with pumpkin pie, and you’ll be in no doubt as to the time of year.The waitstaff is well versed in the carte and ingredients—watch them name drop local farms like a celebrity stylist on the rise.  If the heirloom tomato and mozzarella is available, don’t hesitate. It’s the most popular dish for a reason, starring ripe Ray Yeung Farms heirloom tomatoes and hand-pulled, still-warm cheese.
"
1229,"Surrounded by a number of standard-issue chain eateries in a Natomas shopping center, this Cantonese restaurant is a hidden treasure. On weekend mornings, Chinese families pack the oversized tables for a spectrum of exquisitely prepared dim sum. Evenings however bring groups of friends eager to sample succulent seafood sourced from the massive live tanks that line this restaurant’s back wall.Over on the menu, the dim sum selection features the standard array of steamed, baked and fried delights, including barbecue pork buns, rice noodle rolls, and dumplings. However, diners are bound to also run across a range of more interesting items, like succulent sticky-rice shrimp balls or steamed buns stuffed with crunchy walnuts and sweet red bean paste.  
"
1230,"San Ysidro Ranch is a dreamy setting for this rustic stone ""house,"" punctuated by lush gardens, creekside views, rough-hewn beams and a wood-burning fireplace. In the kitchen, hyper-local regional cooking rules, with many of the herbs, fruits and veggies harvested on the property. Arrive early to walk the grounds before your meal. There is exclusivity in the air, which seems to match the affluent diners and informed servers. Regulars aim for seats on the patio along with simpler bites, like the burger or crab cakes; while others may delve into such finer things as a three-course prix-fixe, starring hamachi sashimi, pan-roasted striped bass, and a signature Meyer-lemon tart.The list of global wines and liquors is far from rote and has everyone smitten.
"
1231,"Find the convivial Canon sequestered away from the downtown bustle. This cool space that contrasts deep tones against bright whites is enveloped by the aromatic smell of smoke, so it’s no surprise that the house is packed most nights.Chef Brad Cecchi is the culinary mastermind and his menu is pivoted around playful small plates. Keeping that in mind, arrive armed with a group as involvement is the bottom line. Whether you’re sipping a cocktail while snacking on Urfa chili drumsticks at the bar, or savoring lamb pavé matched with roasted pineapple and blue corn tortillas, dining here is a global tour de force.

"
1232,"Clean, modern and convivial, Allora is filled with the neighborhood feels, largely thanks to the owners’ passion and dedication. Tastefully decorated in shades of white, wood and deep green, this Cal-Ital kitchen is focused on fresh and sustainable ingredients. Seafood is supremely enticing and consistently woven through their menu of fresh pasta, local fish and Italian wines. The cavatelli, for instance, is made from scratch before being napped in a garlic-and-tomato sauce bobbing with chunks of sausage and summer squash.Come dessert, stick with a straightforward gelato, or just indulge in another glass from Sommelier/co-owner Elizabeth-Rose Mandalou’s large and reasonably priced selection that's displayed through the glass-enclosed cellar.
"
1233,"If the name doesn’t have you salivating yet, the dishes being ferried to and fro by the bustling staff certainly will. Bacon &amp; Butter lures diners and lots of them—you’ll see lasting queues late into the morning—thanks to its promise of good old-fashioned American breakfast and brunch.From flapjacks and crisped potatoes to super-sized cinnamon rolls, this kitchen’s goods taste like Sunday morning at your Mom’s, including all the noise and nagging. The absolute don’t miss however is the biscuit sandwich, featuring egg, cheese, bacon and caramelized onion layered atop fluffy, flaky biscuits and then smothered with bacon gravy for a “wet,” messy and all-out delicious dish. Everything here is big enough for two, but who wants to share when it’s this good?
"
1234,"The name may sound generic, but dining here is an experience unlike any other. Since opening in 1991, The Kitchen has felt like a party from start to finish, hosted by the energetic Chef Kelly McCown. Diners (celebrants are inevitably included) are encouraged to get up and walk around, maybe even peek into the kitchen to chat up the cooks. Really like that truffle dish? The chef invites you to ask for seconds. Having fun is central to everything here.The menu changes monthly and features far-reaching inspiration that incites guests to honor a world of culinary traditions in a single night. Start off with a Japanese ""bonenkai"" party of shrimp with a bit of ginger-infused sake sauce. Then move on to the Périgord truffles grated heavily over butternut squash cannelloni with creamy sauce forestière. Other highlights include a pan-fried cake of house-made kimchi and Dungeness crab, topped with tamarind-glazed pork belly and an edible orchid. In the holiday season, this may be tailed by an old-timey Christmas supper, starring butter-poached beef tenderloin dressed with red wine sauce and potato fondant.Nibble on a divine chocolate chip cookie while waiting for desserts like caramel pudding.
"
1235,"This unassuming taqueria, tucked into a strip mall in Roseville, is a sweet little spot that packs big flavor punch. The salsa bar alone—featuring five outstanding salsas, including a smoky peanut chipotle and tangy salsa verde—is reason enough to warrant a visit.Nixtamalized corn tortillas arrive a beautiful shade of blue to tenderly fold around lip-smacking fillings—like the vegan elote tacos chock-full of sweet corn that's in turn tossed with peanut-chipotle aïoli, lime and chili. Other standouts include the star anise honey-glazed pork belly tacos, paired with crispy caramelized cheese and a halo of green onion; or the shredded, saucy short rib barbacoa version, piled high and crowned by a wedge of avocado and flutter of black sesame seeds.
"
1236,"Hollywood knows how to tell a really good story, but it might want to look in its own backyard for a little inspiration, as this lovely mountain respite undoubtedly has some anecdotes to spill. The soace exudes old-world glam—with a century of history behind it. This log cabin once drew Tinsel Town’s finest, including Charlie Chaplin, Clark Gable and the Rat Pack; today, one is likely to find a newly seasoned crowd.If the hunting trophies didn’t tip you off, this kitchen is best known for its wild game, like elk, bison and buffalo (don’t worry, there’s also chicken and fish for the less adventurous). To start, a creamy and wonderfully seasoned pea soup. Next up, brown butter-sauced rainbow trout, served with sweet acorn squash and salty ricotta salata.
"
1237,"At the end of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, find a windy road that meanders through the plush grounds of the Terranea Resort. Beautiful herb gardens are planted along the sidewalk leading you to Mar’sel’s main entrance. Inside, breathtaking ocean views and a roaring fireplace in the dining room take the chill off the evening breeze.  A sense of opulence pervades everything here, including the superb service.Meals commence with a warm homemade English muffin that may have its own cult following. Every dish looks beautiful and well made, especially those cubes of supremely tender Wagyu beef short ribs, with celery prepared four different ways. For dessert, caramel pot de crème is the house specialty, with ganache, cocoa nibs and flecks of sea salt.
"
1238,"Sushi options have certainly come a long way over the last few decades, as evidenced by this dynamic spot, boasting a sweet price point. Minimally accoutered with a dark wood counter, floral arrangements, and gray floor tiles, everything here feels refined and contemporary.The food, brought to you by veteran chef, Mark Okuda, follows suit. In addition to the omakase, the menu features such specials as a ""JYO"" chirashi bowl, dry-aged grilled fish collar, and Hokkaido snowcrabs. Served in a tall martini glass, halibut arrives with Japanese cucumber, micro shiso, and yuzu-spiked vinegar; tailed by such pristine nigiri as albacore, skipjack, and bonito. Close out with chewy, citrus-dabbed octopus, marinated ora king salmon, and a tuna-packed handroll.
"
1239,"Just a block from the bustle of the Santa Monica Promenade, Tumbi feels worlds away, offering inventive Indian cooking in an industrial-chic setting. There's butter chicken and palak paneer to satisfy western palates, but savvy diners should opt for the deeper cuts—street foods, “pots"" as well as showstopping plates like the sea bass and apricot curry. Topped with taro chips and a blistered poblano, it's a deeply layered, impossibly flavorful creation.That’s not to say that Tumbi can’t handle the classics. In fact, its massive paper dosa is crispy perfection, accompanied by fiery sambar and duo of cooling chutneys. Desserts are especially unique—envision saffron panna cotta, deconstructed carrot halwa, and a ""dessert dosa"" served with creamy Nutella. 
"
1240,"After launching the careers of numerous renowned chefs—including Jonathan Waxman, Nancy Silverton and Sang Yoon—Michael’s has earned the right to be considered an icon. Following its course of history, the recent arrival of an ambitious new chef means that fresh life has been brought into the kitchen. The dining room is a nostalgic and transporting oasis of potted plants, with woven chairs and simple tables to frame out the jungle’s worth of greenery.The cooking succeeds in creatively blending unique ingredients, as seen in the petite quail marinated with turmeric and coconut milk, then grilled for smoky-sweet flavor. A side of branzino is cooked to tender exactness beneath a shatteringly crisp skin and accompanied by black butter sabayon.
"
1241,"It would be easy to write off this rooftop haunt as just another trendy spot, but that would be a shame as the gorgeous space comes with some serious kitchen talent. The cactus garden is a lush perch, but ocean views from the sunset room, replete with natural word and stone, are unbeatable.Contemporary small plates infused with Southern Mediterranean influences is what this team does best, and diners would do well to share. Dishes deliver deliciously surprising flavors, as in a rich whipped eggplant spread served with olive oil in the center and fresh-baked puccia bread on the side. Rigatoni verde with mushroom ragù is best bookended by such textbook treats as a pavlova, topped with white chocolate mousse, vanilla bean ice cream, and fresh passion fruit.
"
1242,"True to its name, this lovely perch overlooking the Santa Monica pier has earned its reputation for great American seafood, thanks to its focus on Maine lobsters and much more. Don’t let its beachy location lure you into thinking that this is a tourist trap. Tightly spaced tables don’t leave much room for privacy and the service seems focused on efficiency, but those expansive views and steaming seafood more than compensate.Lobsters arrive at the height of temptation—find them beautifully steamed until the meat is so incredibly tender, rendering that side of melted butter all but superfluous. Hearty seared crab cakes have a crisp exterior and are generously filled with meat, served alongside peppery arugula, fennel salad and remoulade.
"
1243,"Nestled into a breezy locale just a few blocks from the Pacific, this modern trattoria packs a big culinary punch, thanks largely to the considerable talents of Chef Stefano De Lorenzo (of Piccolo), and partner Lazzaro Marco Ferrari (of Fatto a Mano). On the highly focused Italian menu, expect to find a fragrant soup of the day; a few heartwarming antipasti; as well as a fair amount of beautifully executed pastas, made by hand at a station located front and center in the space. Favorites may include tender calamarata, tossed in a smooth and bright tomato sauce, dotted with oregano, creamy stracciatella and a drizzle of quality olive oil.Run, don’t walk, to this charming spot. Clocking in between $11 and $14, its impeccable signatures are a steal. 
"
1244,"Whether you’re on date night or doodling with the kids, Cassia fits the bill. This neighborhood spot nails that effortless easygoing restaurant vibe, albeit with a ramped-up style that marries winsome brasserie with chic urban loft.Southeast Asian flavors mingle on the menu, which delivers enough variety to keep you coming back. From clay oven-baked breads and house-made charcuterie to an extensive raw bar, the kitchen presents bold offerings. Popular Vietnamese-inspired plates feature pork with vermicelli noodles alongside colonial mash-ups like chopped escargots with lemongrass butter. Roasted black cod, bathed in an anchovy broth and served in a clay pot, may not be much to look at but it's a knockout when it comes to rich, savory flavor.  
"
1245,"A destination since 1983, this local darling has been welcoming guests as old friends to dine on their cuisine, which is a tad Asian, a touch Californian and a bit French. Little seems to have changed through the decades—it is busy, loud and served by an attentive staff. The location, amid boho-chic shops, remains a boon.This kitchen shines by way of a number of signature items, like made-to-order garlic chicken spring rolls or Cantonese duck with plum sauce. The sizzling calamari salad is deliciously seasoned with hot chili paste and presented in a wonton cup over crisp vegetables. Many dishes are served family style, so don’t hesitate to order half-portions when available. At the end, splurge on pleasing desserts like a warm chocolate fondant cake.
"
1246,"Chef Dave Beran presents this captivating French bistro, where standards like onion soup and beef tartare are elevated to their highest reaches. His menu teems with a parade of tempting dishes, thereby creating a particular challenge—keep things light with an endive salad and a delicate amalgam of crab, cream and pickled cauliflower. Otherwise, go full steam with a decadent pâté en croute.Those with deep pockets should apply in advance for the pressed duck for two, already infamous for its cost and limited availability. But the hefty price tag does indeed buy some world-class culinary theatrics, as a chef arrives tableside to work the antique metal press, then reduces the precious juices into a luscious sauce that is spooned over the breast. Should there be room to spare, an exquisite chocolate soufflé paired with vanilla ice cream makes for a dreamy finale.Looking for the ultimate Parisian experience? An elegant marble bar makes for a pretty perch to sip Champagne and spoon osetra caviar onto brown-butter potato chips. And if that's not enough to make one feel special, remember that Pasjoli's prices are also inclusive of the tip. 
"
1247,"Welcome to this modern gem, dressed in earthy hues, vibrant tiles, and leather booths. Unique wall sconces exude an amber glow, while concrete floors epitomize the rustic-chic spirit. Over in the kitchen, the team may be found preparing a litany of Spanish and coastal French plates, finished with California flair. Diners should start though with a creative G&amp;T before digging into the tapas tailed by larger plates—many of which are reimagined classics.Consider the likes of pan con tomate imbued with garlic salt; tortilla Española with paper-thin potatoes and sherry vinegar aïoli; or  moruna puerco, marinated pork skewer draped atop fava bean purée and mojo verde with French feta. Daily specials and dessert (churros, maybe?) are a particular highlight.
"
1248,"Chef Josiah Citrin's iconic dining room is back up and running—even thriving—as it continues to bring old-world charm to this on-trend neighborhood. His expertise lies in delivering a certain fine-dining experience that never goes out of style. It's a lovely change of pace for anyone looking to slow down and be pampered by the highly capable staff.The room is hidden within Citrin and kept out of site by a door. Once inside, the space reveals itself as a luxurious box with pale beige brick, dark wood, and bright artwork. A gentle hum fills the room, ensuring that the ambience is more celebratory than stuffy. Comfort is at the heart of the setting.The open kitchen, with a duck press front and center, oozes with warmth and turns out a contemporary tasting rooted in French tradition. Begin with fried uni cromesquis with kombu honey and black truffle or king crab with yogurt served en chaudfroid. A sense of whimsy and decadence abound in the likes of a French onion dip-inspired custard with crème fraîche and caviar; as well as steamed black bass atop delicate cubes of eggplant with green tomato in a beurre noisette. A pitch-perfect peach tart rounds things off on a brilliantly high note.
"
1249,"Although located in the same building as its sister restaurant Mélisse (via a separate garden entrance), in lieu of its sibling’s tasting menu-only format, the offerings here afford more choice, with a more modest prix-fixe alongside à la carte options. The cuisine still displays Chef Josiah Citrin's signature combination of French technique with an abundance of California's seasonal produce, focusing on updated takes on classically continental flavors with modern, global touches.Lovers of luxury will revel in the caviar selection and opulent truffle add-ons. But even without a shaving of the prized tuber, a dish of mushroom agnolotti with comté and smoked potato cream is an indulgence, as is the chef’s signature fresh capellini with lobster Bolognese.
"
1250,"Chef/partner Jeremy Fox and Executive Chef Andy Doubrava’s seasonal kitchen and wine bar already has the feeling of a timeless institution. The dining room and lounge are toasty and relaxed, largely thanks to a neighborhood vibe and boisterous local clients. A large picture window overlooking the street is a nice contrast against the dark wood tables and cushioned banquettes.The market-inspired menu is proudly crammed with names of local farmers, reminding guests of the humble philosophy at the base of each sophisticated composition. The kitchen's range in talent is clear from the first bite of roasted asparagus set afloat in a cashew cream and topped with grilled, nearly pickled cherries. Such deeply savory and welcomingly ambitious flavors may carry over to a creative combo of earthy beets, grains, and berries all held together with just the right splash of acid. Close on the heels is a massive smoked pork chop finished with delicate trout rote- and raisin-studded beurre blanc.Desserts are quite simply to die for. The sourdough biscuit tantalizes with clouds of whipped cream, macerated strawberries, and basil powder. It's a case of approachable ingredients infused with a bit of creativity and a whole lot of care.
"
1251,"Plant-based chef and lifestyle guru Matthew Kenney successfully brings the vision of pure food and fine wine to the West Coast by way of Plantlab—a lifestyle brand replete with cookbooks, wellness retreats and a plant-based cooking school. Unsurprisingly, his Venice restaurant offers a taste of all that deliciously wholesome and gorgeous vegan goodness with vibrant, complex and beautifully plated dishes.This serene and contemplative space is the perfect backdrop for his bright and flavorful cuisine—and with such prime access to the Santa Monica farmer’s market, the quality of ingredients is all but guaranteed. Heirloom tomato- and zucchini-lasagna finds next-level palatability thanks to a wonderful macadamia nut “ricotta” and sundried tomato sauce.
"
1252,"This Venice Beach trattoria is run by Chef Evan Funke, who studied pasta-making at the celebrated La Vecchia Scuola Bolognese. There may be other delicious and well-prepared menu items, but diners come here for the pastas, listed regionally and made in-house behind a glass-walled laboratorio. The proof lies in the rigatoni all’Amatriciana, a “del Centro” specialty of large, finely ridged tubes in a tomato sauce enriched by delicious guanciale and finished with Pecorino Romano. Wonderful pizzas hail from the wood-burning oven and their dessert crostata is made with equal care and talent.The space is chic and homey with multiple dining sections that add to the overall sense of intimacy. Crowds can arrive early, making this something of a hot spot.
"
1253,"Chef/owner Josiah Citrin works his magic at this casually upscale grill, where nearly everything is cooked over the fire. Wafts of aromatic charred meat greet guests before they’ve even made it through the door. The menu may be inspired by a backyard barbecue, but the décor is a contemporary mix of concrete walls, beige booths and modern artwork.Steaks come with ramekins of sauce like creamy and smoky choron, in addition to the trio of signature condiments on the table. However, this meat is too flavorful to really need anything. Diners may be here for the steaks, but those in the know also order the cabbage baked in embers, served with lemon-sumac yogurt.The bar area is bustling and loud, thanks to the list of happy hour specials.
"
1254,"In its ten-year run, this buzzy restaurant has spawned a to-go counter, highly popular bakery and cookbook. The ambience is ceaselessly upbeat, resulting in a scene that is a major draw among pretty young things.Brick floors and creeping vines fashion a picturesque, garden-like setting that is an idyllic match for their simply prepared Mediterranean menu of pizzas, vegetables and shared plates. Highlights include roasted artichoke hearts, imparted with a lovely smokiness, cooked until the edges are gently charred and centers deliciously creamy. House-made pastas—like nettle rigate tossed in a white wine sauce with morels, chicken hearts and ramps—tailed by a delicious date cake topped with a scoop of ginger gelato are exceptionally tasty.
"
1255,"Big and buzzing with excitement over Chef/co-owner David LeFevre’s creations, this is a fun and casual place that has something for everyone, just a stone’s throw from Manhattan Beach Pier. The food is a proud foray into just about every global cuisine—from pork chili chimichangas and bibimbap to Scotch eggs—but always with clear Californian flair. Their bacon-cheddar buttermilk biscuits are so good that they don’t even need the maple butter that accompanies them.Everything revolves around gathering, conversing and sharing; portions are small so plan your ordering as a group to explore a majority of the menu. Weekends can veer towards loud and crowded with plenty of young families in tow, so this isn’t a place for anyone with a yen for calm.
"
1256,"This tight and warm seafood spot is located just down the block from the ocean. Inside, it's decidedly beachy, flooded with sunlight and colors that make it feel cozy even when it's loud and busy.Raw bar dishes comprise half the menu, which lists different types of oysters, clams and lobsters that can be ordered as set platters or individually. The rest of the carte offers a selection of “old school” classics like gumbo, crab cakes and New England clam chowder revealing huge, meaty unshelled bivalves with chunks of bacon and potatoes. Adventurous palates will take pleasure in the “new school” fare—perhaps grilled octopus with saffron and chorizo, mahi mahi tacos or rockfish ceviche with persimmon. Desserts are well-portioned and genuinely desirable.
"
1257,"Dimly lit and swanky with mid-century modern furnishings, this Manhattan Beach steakhouse is a glorious throwback. In fact, Mad Men could shoot a reunion here without changing a single Scotch glass. The pricey menu is at odds with its beachy surrounds, making this retreat ideal for corporate diners and dressed-up duos.The carte is built around a variety of different cuts and grades of meats—angus, Wagyu and prime—all cooked over a wood-fired grill. Steaks arrive with a choice of one sauce, but be prepared to pay for individual sides, toppings and Parker House rolls. Have a beef with beef? There's a section for that, with vegan and seafood options. Desserts are a treat so indulge in fun takes on classic American layer cakes, sundaes and cherries jubilee.
"
1258,"How much buzz can a smattering of seats, a sushi counter, and a two-person operation generate? A lot, apparently, when you turn a simple space over to the deeply talented Chef Yasuhiro Hirano. Together with his wife—who runs the front of house—this tiny, unadorned spot is responsible for turning out some of the most exciting sushi in town.The chef's particular magic lies in weaving together a few key components, including the exotic fish that he ages before blending with a host of ingredients. He’s able to master dishes that other, more established pros haven't—and to such precise, creative and polished effect.With such an intimate setting, diners are bound to be schooled in the process. Chef Hirano is clearly excited to share his methods and craft, and welcomes questions while he works. Then again, one may opt for silence to savor such delicacies as tender mantis shrimp glossed in eel sauce, or plump Kusshi oyster with ponzu gelée. Slow-braised monkfish liver may then be presented with a perfect sprinkling of black pepper, while sea bream is enriched by a dot of pickled plum sauce and shiso.

1259,"Everything is fresh and fun at this favored spot, thanks to a passionate staff who serve Cal-Ital cuisine. A laid-back vibe and superb drinks that mix everything from herbs and fruits to veggies and shrubs ensure that everyone is having a blast. The heart of the dining room is a large communal table, set amid old timey barstools and Edison bulbs to glorify the city’s hip feel.The entire menu is built around pizzas, roasted meats and vegetables emerging from a wood-fired oven. Some may dive into the duck egg pizza (a menu staple since day one), but if you’re feeling more adventurous go for the anchovy pie with fried capers. Regulars know to save room to sample seasonal antipasti and homemade pasta, like pappardelle with a slow-cooked short rib Bolognese.
"
1260,"This lovely little bistro is tucked into an unassuming mall a few blocks from the beach, giving it that ideal neighborhood feel and easy seaside vibe. Natural wood and serene colors run the length of the space, which features a large communal farmhouse table in the middle of the room.The friendly Baran brothers can usually be found on site, doing their best to make sure every patron feels welcome. The kitchen turns out a seasonal menu that's constantly evolving but may include a filet of beef with a sumptuous black garlic-Sichuan sauce, chili broccoli and pickled shiitakes. Desserts like mini buttery bundt cakes are paired with ginger-blueberry sorbet and apricot coulis for a refreshing treat. Sip as you go with a choice from over 40 craft beers.
"
1261,"A Santa Monica landmark dating back to the ‘20s, the onetime Wilshire has been reimagined with an Italian streak. It’s hard to imagine a more exquisitely Angeleno locale than this sprawling courtyard, encased by massive pine trees and illuminated by twinkling string lights. Though sweet and homey, the dining room is the also-ran, likely to sit deserted on all but the frostiest of evenings.Though Fia's menu appears routine on the surface, it's full of inventive twists, as seen in the sweet and spicy bomboloni used to scoop up a chilled Jonah crab salad, or the intense 24-year-old Parmesan that lends depth to a cacio e pepe-inspired risotto. Save room for the ethereal goat cheesecake—those notes of mango and black sesame will have you floating out.
"
1262,"The name is as cute as a button, but the wood-fired pizzas turned out of this kitchen are serious business. Brought to you by the Rustic Canyon family, this cheery establishment shines the spotlight on a host of perfectly blistered pies, homemade pastas, and an outstanding, easily overlooked pound cake that may just end pp being the highlight of your meal—also wood-fired and finished with honey and whipped cream.A seat at the counter offers diners a bird’s eye view of the chefs as they methodically roll out paper-thin pizza crusts, lacing them with tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella and a flutter of sea salt. Tender gnocchi made with brown butter and dyed orange from garnet yam may then arrive tossed with charred radicchio, hazelnuts, and cranberries. 
"
1263,"Named for Chef Jeremy Fox's young daughter, this homespun delight serves up square meals with satisfying swerves. A “Sloppy Jeremy” pairs old-school beef ragù and Texas toast with new-school horseradish goat cheese. In the same vein, juicy grilled chicken takes a tropical turn with a mango-pineapple chimichurri. Even jiggly Jell-O pie makes a comeback, infused here with strawberry, hibiscus, and garnished with candied rose petals.While the restaurant's paper menus and blue-plate specials are diner-inspired, its interior skews modern-trendy, thanks to light wood tables, whitewashed walls and schoolhouse-like chairs. A thoughtful kids’ menu keeps tots happy, allowing the grown-ups to luxuriate in hand-picked wines that go with each special. 
"
1264,"This is a place for purists, where guests are warned with a pleasant smile that California rolls and other such frivolity will not be served here. Dining in the presence of Chef Eddie Okamoto means that only good things will follow, including an in-depth discussion of Hokkaido’s ice plankton or the fish you just ate that lived deep underwater and was so rich in omega-3 (read: fat) because it could hardly move.Sushi may go on to include slices of Japanese yellowtail toro—briny, smooth and shining. The chef’s special selection though features the likes of golden eye snapper resting on shiso over rice, dabbed with yuzu kosho; or live shrimp swiftly cut, topped with roe and served with the tempura-fried head. The omakase is pricey but always worth it.
"
1265,"Beneath a striped awning, this corner location is warm and elegant, with sleek leather banquettes, wood cabinetry and rustic woven chairs adorning the dark blue interior.Chef Raphael Lunetta helms the kitchen, delivering dishes that have their roots from his time at JiRaffe. Imagine the likes of thick slices of an enticingly browned pork chop with wild rice and bacon. The dinner menu is an au courant list of impressive cooking, including crispy duck with quince or wood-grilled barbecue salmon. For dessert, try the rich, dense and burnt-sugar butterscotch pot de crème served in a coffee cup with a dollop of whipped cream.In addition to Lunetta’s contemporary food, their all-day café next door is a pleasant spot for coffee and pastries.
"
1266,"Its environs may be modest, but the décor inside this rustic gem is colorful, featuring floor-to-ceiling murals, brick arches and high-backed wooden seats. All of this combined sets an authentic backdrop for delving into their menu of carefully crafted Oaxacan cuisine.Showcasing an array of delicacies from tamales to tlayudas, regulars may start with molote, masa dumplings filled with potatoes, chorizo and fried until golden. The house-made mole is a revelation of 32 ingredients, from almonds and chiles to chocolate, which combine to create a deep, rich and complex sauce perfect for smothering on chicken and soaking in fresh tortillas. Portions are ample, but try to save room for the subtle and seasonal pumpkin flan that arrives dripping with caramel.
"
1267,"Every pizza at this area darling begins with a nod to Neapolitan tradition: start with the perfect dough and bake it into a crust that remains crisp and light right through the middle. This careful process and that almighty oven shipped from Italy can be observed with longing through the glass-walled kitchen. The dining room also conjures the homeland through Mediterranean-blue murals and furnishings.To top that crust, many pizzas go on to include premium ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes and fior di latte, which arrives several times a week from Italy. Alternatively, deck your pie with a more creative and locally minded blend of embellishments. A choice of appetizers, gourmet salads and luscious desserts round out the menu.
"
1268,"Do not let its exterior fool you since Baltaire is a real beauty. It is equal parts sultry and spacious with a stunning bar to boot. It has all of the bells and whistles synonymous with steakhouses (think dark wood and leather) yet it eschews that tired old boys club ambience, offering an entirely welcoming vibe instead. The extensive menu has a number of pleasing appetizers, including  grilled artichokes, expertly charred and served alongside a Meyer lemon aïoli, and fromage blanc-based Kalamata olive dip with toasted baguette. Of course, few things beat a broiled three-inch thick bone-in Porterhouse with its rich and beefy buttery flavor, served with oversized platters of sautéed button mushrooms with sweet onions and crispy roasted German potatoes.
"
1269,"Perfectionists will thrill to a meal at this Westside sushiya, where everything from the homemade tofu to the kitchen's selection of seasonal fish is nothing short of exquisite. Everything inside the dining room is finely calibrated to highlight the wizardry behind the ubiquitous bar—soft lighting, white walls, wood accents and handcrafted ceramics. Even the wine and sake list is restrained, with each varietal specifically chosen to complement the fish.Despite such delicacy, Mori is far from stuffy. This ship is steady with Chef Masanori ""Maru"" Nagano at the helm, explaining the provenance of each bite of the nigiri and omakase. A majority of the selection is flown in directly from Japan—with a few worthy exceptions, including the luscious Santa Barbara uni. The tasting might start with a dollop of creamy tofu brushed with soy sauce and a dab of wasabi, before progressing into wonderful bites of seared madai and lightly torched baby barracuda. Nigiri are ever-changing but may showcase sweet shrimp; rich and tart kohada; or outstanding buri.A cooling scoop of buckwheat ice cream serves as the final memento, but really, it’s the savory eats that will linger on for weeks to come.
"
1270,"This sister spot to ramen palace Tsujita specializes in tan tan ramen, a Japanese favorite that’s equal parts tantanmen (dipping ramen) and spicy Sichuan dan dan noodles. The original bowl is light and gently herbaceous, with bold notes of peanut and garlic accenting the ground pork and tofu, while the “downtown” version is tangier and nuttier. If you’d rather slurp sans soup, either bowl can be ordered “dry” as well.The “killer” in the restaurant's moniker comes from the range of spice levels offered to diners—opt for the six out of six, and you’ll be supremely grateful for the pitcher of water provided to each table. All those heaping portions of chili oil are matched by the casual, cheerful dining room, which is dressed in shades of screaming red. 
"
1271,"One bite of a glistening piece of sashimi at this Westside gem and it will come as no surprise that Chef/owner Ken Namba was raised in the environs of Japan's famous Tsukiji fish market. Namba isn’t content with the classics, and sashimi here will include varieties the likes of which many have never sampled before.Whether you order sushi and sashimi à la carte or select one of three omakase menus, don’t expect tradition, as Kiriko likes to play with your food with flavor enhancements and distinctive presentations. While some hit the mark—the Dungeness crab salad deconstructed in a martini glass elicits audible approval from diners—others swing and miss with a heavy-handed approach. Still, this chef has been at it since 1999 so he’s no flash in the pan.
"
1272,"If you want serious nigiri and utterly unique maki that won’t break the bank, make a beeline for this elegant retreat. The servers move as quickly as the chef’s knives, whisking to and fro in the modern, lofty space. In the back corner, find an L-shaped sushi bar that offers a front row seat to the itamae working their magic.Kyoto-born Executive Chef Yoya Takahashi prioritizes local, seasonal and sustainable ingredients, weaving them into pristine, delicious and whimsical little dishes. Maki are most popular here and arrive clean and concise, sporting a great variety of textures and impressive handiwork. Case in point: the Asylum Roll showcasing soy paper, chopped toro, avocado, and lobster. Nigiri highlights include bonito brushed with soy and ginger.
"
1273,"An airy and chic space imbued with wood, tile, and natural hues. You've seen it before? Perhaps, but this Runway Playa Vista haunt is a modern steakhouse that bestows equal love to vegetables galore. Inside, nab a seat in the bar area set below a dramatic ceiling or at one of the booths and banquettes on the right.A window in the back offers a view of the kitchen, and ergo, all the action. Plates turned out of here are ample and possess a certain decadence—think asparagus with brown butter and crab. Even all the expected elements are given a creative twist, as in the pastrami ""steak"" with rye bread and caraway sauerkraut. Sides, like coal-roasted carrots with preserved lemon butter or saffron rice ""cake"" with pickled grapes, are all depth and balance.
"
1274,"Unless you're heading to LAX, this culinary retreat may seem out of the way, but in reality, family-friendly Ayara lures diners from far and wide. The space inside is simple, yet no one seems to mind—expect crowds during peak times. This kitchen is best known for its Thai recipes that have been passed down and transformed with local ingredients. The menu is packed with everything from tried-and-true pleasures to more inventive items, like the spicy beef salad featuring grilled tri-tip over cabbage slaw dressed with lime and fish sauce. Rich curries, especially the khao soi with coconut, free-range chicken, noodles and eye-watering heat, are also a great bet.Come for lunch, offered until 4:00 P.M.,and enjoy a starter, entrée and drink for a pretty price.
"
1275,"Set in a nondescript shopping center, this highly pedigreed settler has managed to keep a low profile. But discerning locals know a great master when they see one, and Taketoshi Azumi is indeed the real deal. The chef has worked for two decades at top spots on both coasts and comes from a family of sushi connoisseurs. In fact, Shin is named for the Tokyo restaurant run by his late father, whose former sign now hangs behind the counter.Despite its pedigree, the vibe is affable and laid-back. Tables fill with as many diners ordering lunch combos as the omakase, and the friendly chef engages each customer as he slices their fish to order. His approach to shari is singular and highly personal, with a dense texture and mild flavor from sake lees vinegar. It makes a delicate base for some of the more unusual nigiri around, like a tiny bundle of Japanese chives tied with crispy nori and topped with bonito. Then look forward to the very rare and lightly torched cherry trout, or sakura masu, which is a marvel thanks to its smoky outer layer giving way to melting richness.Finally, all the luxurious standards are perfectly executed here, including Hokkaido uni, scallops, and top-grade fatty tuna.
"
1276,"Since 1982, Shaherzad has been the established choice among this neighborhood’s myriad Persian dining options. Inside, the room is a pretty combination of cream walls, blue furnishings and metallic accents. Larger tables attract groups of well-dressed ladies during lunch.Everyone is welcomed with a basket of hot flatbread, served right from the oven on display through a glass wall. The menu goes on to list just about anything that a fan of Iranian cooking could wish for, including platters of crunchy salads, sizzling skewers of meat and an array of succulent stews. Kebabs are served with rice, but for a small charge you can upgrade to pilafs with wonderful combinations of sweet and savory flavors—like sour cherries and sautéed onion.
"
1277,"Make your way into this beige building, marked by a black-and-white sign, to enter an art gallery. From there, proceed into the neatly sectioned off dining room—featuring impossibly high ceilings, muted green velvet banquettes, and a bar in the back.Be sure to study the water menu, before breaking ice over a cocktail. The food is contemporary American with a Californian accent, and dishes—not unlike diners themselves—are eclectic and stylish. Sharing is key to fully appreciate this menu, which offers the likes of toasted quinoa as a base for a petit half avocado filled with scallop ceviche with lime, pickled jalapeño, shaved radish, and lavender flowers. Glazed lobster with vanilla risotto renders such rich and sweet flavors that you won't miss dessert.
"
1278,"Sitting inside this pleasant dining room feels remarkably secluded, with its smoked glass windows (to obscure the noise and traffic outside), heavy brocade drapery and walls lined with polished stone. Towards the rear of the space, a tanor oven churns out hot flatbreads to welcome diners as soon as they arrive.The cuisine offers specialties that focus on salads, grilled meats and slowly simmered stews enriched with dried lime and pomegranate. Start with the soulful classic ash reshteh, thick with beans, broken strands of pasta and finished with a drizzle of kashk (fermented whey). A wedge of the hearty tahchin is a treat, layering saffron-yellow basmati rice with creamy yogurt, chunks of white meat chicken and baked until golden brown.
"
1279,"Chef Nate Tauer along with Chefs/owners Phillip Frankland Lee and Margarita Kallas-Lee are the players behind this hip concept. An industrial space with cement floors and funky lighting, the tasting menu is one for the books. Offered in a separate area, drinks and a snack kick things off. The staff is wonderfully engaging as they bestow upon diners a host of delectable, hyper-local items. Your first course may reveal a mushroom duxelles cannolo, tailed by potato and sunchoke custard. The mastery of this team lies in their ability to take full advantage of Cali's natural bounty, as seen in an exalted take on the caprese, starring marigold tomatoes and fennel flowers.Desserts, like goat milk-white chocolate mousse, promise nothing less than sweet dreams.
"
1280,"Los Angeles-born Chef Niki Nakayama is a proud pioneer in the modern kaiseki tradition, yet she’s humble enough to remain a constant in her dining room, checking in on each guest to ensure their every comfort. In this way, the much-lauded restaurant feels utterly personal, as though for this moment in time, you are the only diner that matters.Set in an attractive and neutral-toned dining room, the space holds a devoted, almost cult-like reverence. It makes sense: guests don’t want to miss a morsel of Chef Nakayama’s genius. Her clever creations are delightfully unbound by Japanese tradition; instead, she rather inventively works within the spirit of it.A nightly tasting menu might begin with a small glass of apple sake, followed by pristine scallop tartare coupled with sanbaizu gelée, carrot purée, toasted sunflower seeds and crispy carrot chips. From there, tiny yet exquisite dishes pour forth, including simply grilled branzino paired with rich Santa Barbara sea urchin, shiitake mushrooms and ponzu; or a tender lobster dumpling with king crab bobbing in dashi. Al dente spaghettini with abalone slices, pickled cod roe and black truffle is a personification of the chef's unique style.
"
1281,"Tucked away near the behemoth Sony Pictures lies this oasis of South Indian food. The simple interior of this local gem is fitted with bright purple chairs, colorful roses and booths lining the wall. But really, you're here for the food, which specializes in flavors from Kerala, a state set on the southwestern tip of the Indian peninsula. The lunch buffet is a popular way to sample various items, including rasam vada—a deep-fried lentil donut served with spicy and tangy rasam.Be sure to save room though for the divine ghee roast dosa, as this tall, triangular and crisp creation served with sambar and chutney is mighty impressive even as it floats out of the kitchen. Simmering with spices, Kerala chicken curry will have you returning in no time.
"
1282,"Sichuan food is on the menu at this unexpected spot, set within the Westfield Mall Century City. Inside, the lofty ceiling features modern fixtures that hang over the room’s gold screens, blue silks, and black lacquer accents. A buzzy bar and open kitchen augment the vibe. A bulk of the guests prefer to sit outdoors, so the patio is mighty popular, with blue seats that match an array of vases set along the back ""fence.""Each dish is prepared with care. Some, like the whole pork hock lodged in red chili oil or eggplant in garlic and chili sauce, may be humble but flaunt balanced flavors. Thick dan dan noodles may then be twirled around spicy minced pork infused with bits of bracing scallion. The fish fillet is a classic rendition and makes a fine finish.
"
1283,"When a restaurant is housed in the venerable Waldorf Astoria, luxury and glamour are assured. High ceilings and imposing columns strive to fill the space, which is at once airy and modern, crisp and luminous. It also seems rather fitting that the romantic patio is covered with passion fruit vines. Well-heeled types come here to see and be seen, and the menu is calibrated to their pizza and pasta preferences.Don’t hesitate to let this kitchen take you beyond those tasty pizzas and try one of their signatures, like the caviar egg. Seared black cod in a spicy, herbal broth demonstrates that delicious blend of Asian influences that the eponymous chef’s kitchen is renowned for. Well-composed desserts include a wonderfully fruity maple-roasted pear.
"
1284,"Find this beloved Italian-Japanese fusion restaurant between boutiques in an open-air mall. The small, well-appointed room is dark with shellacked wood as well as red-and-black motifs. All of this draws the eye towards that white-tiled wall where a line of itamae are hard at work in the open kitchen.The cultural collision is best seen in dishes such as fig sashimi with black truffle, burrata and yuzu, or carpaccio of red snapper with Asian pear, hearts of palm, yuzu and balsamic truffle oil. Forward-looking specials include vinegar-bathed halibut, topped with arugula and artichokes, and tempura is a high point, whether as soft-shell crabs or Kumamoto oysters. Seared marinated tuna handrolls with crispy garlic and cucumber are delightful.
"
1285,"This sophisticated dame deserves a crown for her longevity, adherence to classic recipes, and chalkboards of whimsical specials. A local fixture and operated by the second generation of the founding family, it's a simple, colorful space, flaunting framed accolades on one wall and photos of Hollywood's elite on another.We suggest checking out the weekly farmer’s market dish, also known as “chef’s choice,"" filled with seasonal produce and always flavorful. Travel through the mind of this chef by way of regional and traditional items, like fried chicken wings with chili sauce or green curry with shrimp. Barbecue pork is marinated with soy and garlic, then grilled to juicy tenderness; while papaya salad dressed with lime and palm sugar is a textural pleasure.

"
1286,"There are few restaurants in the nation dedicated to tempura, but Endo makes a legitimate case for this impossibly delicate and difficult technique. Its distinguished reputation in Japan has made inroads in LA, presenting the artistic style of cooking that is so much more than just “frying.”For a true introduction, go for the priciest of the three prix-fixes and experience scallops stuffed with caviar. Then indulge in cool appetizers, such as “wild mountain plants” with vinegary okra. The main attraction centers on a handmade copper cauldron heating a blend of sesame and vegetable oil, as well as their distinct wine-based batters (one for coating fish, another for vegetables). What emerges, from summery corn to uni wrapped in shiso, is pure joy.
"
1287,"Few restaurants place such an emphasis on both sukiyaki and shabu-shabu as this classic-meets-contemporary retreat, where premium A5 Wagyu beef reigns supreme. Glass and blonde wood panels lend a cool and airy vibe; while floor tiles, ambient lighting, and custom bamboo blinds make things specially intimate.Inside, tables are outfitted with a conventional grill for cooking. Your meal may begin with such cold bites as arugula and spinach ohitashi with lobster or a shiso-infused vichyssoise. Diners may then go for the traditional, special, or à la carte sukiyaki, complete with an appetizer, unabashedly rich beef tongue, leafy veggies, and three cuts of Yazawa beef. Truffle-kissed zōsui (or ojiya) is a delicious, subtle, and crowning way to seal this feast.
"
1288,"This local treasure has been earning accolades since it first opened in 1987. Today it continues to flourish as a family affair, as the founder’s daughter is running the show.The front dining room is welcoming, but the large and enclosed back patio is really the place to be—pleasantly green and breezy with ceiling fans, hanging plants and potted palms. It's the perfect setting for relishing the kitchen’s Nayarit-style cooking that showcases shrimp and fish imported from Sinaloa. Those shrimp appear again and again, perhaps breaded and fried in tacos, or sautéed head-on in a bright red sauce of roasted chilies and beer. Enjoy their fish fried, cooked whole or even inside heaping bowls of ceviche with bracing, lemony flavors and a basket of chips.
"
1289,"This Parisian-style bistro landed upon the scene to much hype and favor. Conceived by the same team behind Republique, the light blue structure with dark blue trim exudes all the French vibes in the heart of SoCal. A suspended bicycle marks its entrance; then walk a few steps down to the magnificently lit space, furnished with a mini bar and mighty wine collection.Begin with the infamous bread displayed on a metal rack, before moving on to such buttery, beautiful classics as caramelized onion tarte Tatin—a twist on the original with goat cheese and thyme. Perfectly cooked steak au poivre then arrives with peppercorn sauce and a pile of fries—it's so decadent that you may just be fine sans dessert. Good thing that, as these prices can add up in a flash.
"
1290,"Dining at Vespertine is trippy, unsettling and out of the ordinary. Here, Chef Jordan Kahn executes his singular vision by preparing a cuisine that takes diners on a sensory, albeit futuristic, journey. If that doesn't conjure up a host of dramatic images, its monastic soundtrack will certainly do the trick. The result is a unique experience, which commences on the open-air rooftop where guests are presented with a welcome cocktail and canapés, before being escorted downstairs to the somewhat severe dining room.Following suit, highly professional servers deliver this specific narrative. The chef has not forgotten his background at The French Laundry or Alinea, and uses it to build something wholly unexpected. Fans wait with bated breath for a highly conceptual meal that can last for hours and may not be for everyone. But these stunning plates are unforgettable, like Hokkaido sea scallop with yuzu broth or grilled golden eye snapper with crispy skin, preserved bougainvillea and a tart strawberry sauce. After innovative desserts such as cucumber cream with redwood leaf granita or a surprising sphere of sweet snap peas, kiwi and spruce, sojourn to the garden for some superb mignardises.
"
1291,"This may appear to be a counter-service, first-come first-serve sort of joint for grabbing a bite, but Chef Sang Yoon has turned this—and the humble burger—into so much more. Made with dry-aged beef, caramelized onions and bacon compote, the elevated wares found in this kitchen are treasured as one of the country’s first (and perhaps finest) craft burgers. The market-driven menu goes on to include items that one would not expect from a pub—imagine an heirloom tomato salad with Persian cucumbers dressed in a sweetened basil-goat’s yogurt sauce; or even grilled skewers of deliciously spiced Sonoma lamb.Housed in the historic Helms Bakery district, this Culver City location is more modern and comfortable than the Santa Monica original.
"
1292,"This modern, upscale bistro arrives courtesy of Sang Yoon, the culinary genius behind the pioneering burger gastropub, Father’s Office. The interior is sleek, smart and contemporary—the perfect backdrop to Yoon’s bright, bold culinary style. A seat facing the open kitchen is one of the best in the house, bringing the heat in more ways than one.The eclectic menu spans the Eastern hemisphere, from the Sichuan province of China to Vietnam, Malaysia and even India. Only a talented kitchen could pull off such a wide-spanning menu with integrity, and the team at Lukshon does it seamlessly. Chinese eggplant is paired with spiced tomato sambal and a cool yogurt raita; while steamed sea bream is complete with “black bean ghee” and pea shoots.
"
1293,"The architecturally intriguing Hayden Tract district is the perfect backdrop for this adventurous little beau, brought to you by Jordan Kahn (of Vespertine). Those unfamiliar with the aesthetic might find this highly functional space too minimal, but every detail returns your attention to the food.Each plate is a complex composition of flavors that are bound to delight and surprise. Begin with such harmonious starters as roasted red beets served chilled along with red quinoa, sweet blackberries and pumpkin seed butter. Roasted cauliflower, brushed with a black garlic spread atop a sunflower seed crumble and a warm buttermilk sauce, is given a new lease on life. And, namelaka, a light chocolate pudding dusted with cucumber snow, steals the show.
"
1294,"Set amidst the luxury shops of Rodeo Drive, this osteria is housed within the renowned and glorious Gucci boutique. A full-length mirror by the elevator on the ground floor is ideal for last minute primping before riding up to the third floor, where the restaurant is located. Then, make your way into this striking space, dressed up with mostly alfresco tables, ringed by lush greenery, and set under a canvas canopy.Chef Massimo Bottura has put the talented Mattia Agazzi in charge of this kitchen, and the results are very impressive indeed. This is cooking that is at once whimsical and grounded. Seafood salad arrives perfectly warm and tender, dressed with lemon, olive oil, and shaved radish; while risotto is camouflaged as pizza with tomato, stracciatella, and burnt caper dust evoking the taste of a charred crust. Thumb-sized tortellini, filled with the classic mortadella, veal and prosciutto mixture, sits pretty in a glossy pool of Parmigiano Reggiano-enriched sauce.The meal ends on a high note with a concise choice of desserts, including a decadent ensemble stacking smoked chocolate ganache, miso caramel, chocolate sorbet, and cocoa nibs.
"
1295,"In contrast to its grand hotel setting, this bright and modern Wolfgang Puck retreat is buzzy, but whether you're dressed up or down, the hospitable servers will treat you like their favorite table.Expect top quality, simply prepared meats and market-driven fare here. As is true with so many of his other establishments, the menu here focuses on classics that never seem to go out of style. This is deliciously clear in the Maryland blue crab and Louisiana shrimp dressed in a tangy “Louis” sauce set over horseradish panna cotta. There are plenty of cuts from across the US to choose from, but it's best to skip right to the Japanese Wagyu from the Miyazaki prefecture. But don't fret if you're not into red meat, as the versatile kitchen pays equal attention to other such delectable items as Maine diver scallops and roasted poussin. From snow peas to autumn squash, the kitchen sources top-notch, locally grown ingredients and even the sides are dazzling in their delicate simplicity. Dessert is a don't-miss, especially with the likes of Basque cheesecake with its slightly charred top and fluffy center accompanied by juicy blueberries and mulberries.

1296,"Every quarter of the year, Maude finds its new culinary theme in a wine region. Whether focusing on Italy's Tuscany or Spain’s Rioja, the menu is a creative exploration of the profound connection between food and drink. Despite having to refocus each season, the emphasis on viticulture and cuisine ensures its success as a wine destination.Make your way inside to discover an intimate and elegant dining room, with views of an open kitchen. While the latter is fun to peek into, it remains peaceful throughout the meal. ​​​​Chef Curtis Stone's cooking, while serious, is consistently delightful. Find evidence in his recent Tuscan-inspired menu, which opened with such delightful bites as raw baby vegetables crowned by olive oil jam. Then chicories—starring orange-glazed and roasted radicchio with pistachio foam—arrived deliciously cool and nutty; tailed by fish stew reimagined as a single spot prawn paired with tender squid. Of course, it's hard to resist the ""Ravioli Mugellani""—filled with smooth potato and plated with an espuma of pecorino.A meal at Maude may conclude with dessert—like a tartlet of Campari cream topped with a sugar cage mimicking Il Duomo—which is served next door in the ""wine loft.""
"
1297,"With a name that translates to ""look at me,"" swanky location, and delightful neighbors (hello Wally’s), Mírame is quite the babe. Beverly Hills may not be a destination for Mexican cuisine, but thanks to this arrival, that's certainly changed. The décor is minimal, allowing the focus to remain on the food, which in turn strikes a perfect balance between traditional and modern.Dishes are refined, flaunting top ingredients and myriad sauces. Daily taco specials, like crispy fish with crema and cabbage slaw or lengua with onions and herbs, are evergreen hits; while the salmon skin chicharrón with fermented garlic aïoli is an unctuous feat. In the same vein—smoked yellowtail tostada with earthy truffle is set aglow with micro greens and makes a fragrant finish.
