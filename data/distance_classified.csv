"Most of the time, it’s fun to be right. It’s fun to Google “Which Harry Potter book do they mention ‘snogging’ in for the first time?” and confirm that it is, in fact, Prisoner of Azkaban like you said, and not Goblet of Fire, which your brother put $10 on. But there are other times when you kind of hope that you’re wrong, like when you think you might have left the oven on and you’re about to board a flight for a two-week trip. Or when you go to a new upscale restaurant in Rittenhouse thinking it will probably be just like all of the other overpriced spots in the area where you eat mashed potatoes topped with caviar and get called “madame” or “sir.” In those situations, you hope you’re horribly wrong.  ,Luckily, we were wrong about Spice Finch. Even though it just looks like another fancy Rittenhouse spot reserved for a rich aunt’s birthday, it’s actually the kind of place you can go for a casual weeknight dinner when you’re okay with spending a little extra money, drinking a $14 cocktail, and eating some really good Mediterranean food.,When you first walk into Spice Finch, you won’t notice anything super different about it. This place has the same heavy wooden tables and leather-backed chairs that most other special occasion spots have, and the servers are dressed in black and white uniforms like they were just transferred from LaCroix down the street. But somewhere between your garlic yogurt crudité and broccoli tabouleh, you’ll realize this place isn’t exactly The Bellevue.,You’ll see Flyers fans at the big bar wearing jerseys and watching the game on TV, while other people befriend the bartender. Back at your table, your server will pull over a chair to sit and walk you through the big menu. All of a sudden, this isn’t just a place for the marketing dinner your boss asked you to plan—it’s somewhere you actually want to hang out.,The food here kind of surprises you as well. It’s just as expensive as any other special occasion spot in Rittenhouse, which is another reason we initially put it in the “only use in case of emergencies” box, but it’s mostly very good and gets better with every course. The appetizers, which range from mahon croquettes to shishito peppers with tahini and harissa, are all solid, and the fattoush with cucumber, green beans, and tomato vinaigrette is one of the only salads we’d go out of our way for when we live a block away from Honeygrow. But where Spice Finch really impresses is the entrees. Especially the lamb ribs, which are sweet, tender, and covered with a glaze of spices and charred skin. The charred octopus and the berbere carrots are worth getting too, but the lamb ribs are the one thing you’ll be thinking about two months later when you’re at a wedding and a disappointing plate of flank steak ends up in front of you.,That being said, there are bound to be things that aren’t perfect on a menu this large, and they could probably cut about 10 dishes without anyone noticing. The broccoli tabouleh, for example, isn’t something we’d tell anyone to get here. It’s not that it’s bad, as it’s pretty hard to mess up tabouleh, but adding broccoli to it doesn’t make the dish any more unique or flavorful. And the croquettes could be significantly improved by losing the avocado tomatillo underneath them—there are a bunch of sauces you can order a la carte, like the harissa, that work much better.,Even if you’ve walked by Spice Finch, looked in the window, and thought to yourself, “I probably can’t go in there if I’m wearing anything that can go in a normal washing machine,” you should give it another shot. You’ll be surprised at how easily you start to feel comfortable here, and you’ll be happy your first impressions were way, way off.,",/philadelphia/reviews/spice-finch,0.8821388600948966,579
"When we’re in the mood for a creamy bowl of grits, we head to Booker’s Restaurant &amp; Bar in Cedar Park. They serve them three ways here–with shrimp, andouille sausage, or catfish. And since the Southern spot only serves brunch in the daytime, you can find us ordering the grainy breakfast go-to on a cold day, along with cheesecake french toast, fried chicken and waffles, a burger topped with cherry peppers and caramelized onions, or huevos rancheros.,Beyond steak and eggs and salmon sliders to start our days, their dinner menu is full of comforting selections like jerk oxtail, seafood mac and cheese, and a creole vegan jambalaya that mixes peppers, onions, black beans, spicy mushroom tarragon, and yellow rice. The portions are on the large side, which is great because we only bring our families or group of closest friends here. Be sure to make a reservation as the dining room is small, and if you’re hoping to walk in, you may be stuck watching a few trolleys roll by on Baltimore Ave while you wait outside. ,But you could also just pass time with their Happy Hour (which runs from 5-7pm) they exclusively serve on their outdoor dining set-up. During the discount hours, they have $6 cocktails like whiskey gingers and margaritas, $5 wines, $7 city wides, and hot fried chicken sliders that are covered with sriracha aioli and pickles and served on brioche buns.,",/philadelphia/reviews/bookers-restaurant-bar,0.8637985170275357,1373
"Jim’s is a retro, counter-service place on South Street that's always in the conversation when talking about Philly’s best cheesesteaks. Because of that, there’s always going to be a line out the door, so you have two options. You could bring a beach chair, suck it up, and wait it out for this messy, cheesy sandwich. Or, if you’d rather sit down in a coffee shop and eat your sandwich at a table, you could head across the street to Milkboy and order your Jim’s cheesesteak there. They’ll usually deliver it to your table before you would have gotten to the front of the line at Jim’s anyway.",/philadelphia/reviews/jims-south-st,0.8610818084755893,1298
"You like Fork. Your boss likes Fork. Your neighbor that you’ve never spoken to, but always wave at when you see him outside walking his dog loves Fork. It’s a people pleaser, and it’s a great place to go with a big group for a birthday or any other reason that you and your friends get together these days. The space in Old City has white tablecloths and definitely feels upscale, but you won’t feel like you’re at a stuffy steakhouse or a 200-year-old country club with a room that only male members are allowed in to smoke cigars. Fork has a diverse seasonal menu that includes things like squash and apple soup to a big steak for two, and it’s all excellent.,",/philadelphia/reviews/fork,0.8527877399772141,615
"Our review for this Israeli grill could probably take a similar form to an Oscar speech where the actor lists off every important moment in their career. Except, in this case, we would just be rattling off everything we love about this restaurant. But we're sure that somewhere between ""and thank you to the sizzling chicken, babganoush, and buttery pita,"" we'd start hearing the music to play us off. Simply, there are just too many things we love about this open-air spot. The most important thing we want to relay to you is this: a meal at Laser Wolf will be one of the most memorable you can have in Philly.,This Kensington restaurant comes from the same team behind Zahav, so it’s no surprise you’ll start your night here with about a dozen vegetable-based mezze like stewed beets and sweet pears, pickled celery root, and bright green gigante bean piyaz all tossed into some small metallic cups. It’s pretty much the best paint palette ever, but instead of a bunch of acrylics, you get vegetables served to you in a way that makes you feel like you’re tasting them for the first time. And like Zahav, they have the fluffiest pita and best hummus in town. ,Outside of the tray of starters, there are a few other things you should order, or you’ll have deep regrets watching other tables dive in. One of them is the tuna shishlik, which consists of thick juicy cubes of fish with perfect grill lines—all smothered in a peppery chile-based sauce. When you come with a bunch of your friends or a handful of strangers you bribed because switching your preference to six guests got you an earlier reservation, go for the large branzino filled with ginger and tomatoes for $112. And always end your meal with the creamy brown sugar soft serve that’s so creamy that we’d eat even it when the temperature dips below freezing. ,Outside of the servers rocking Hawaiian-style shirts, you can tell from the paper lanterns dangling from the ceiling and neon signs on the wall that this is a place where you can hang out with some friends and not take things too seriously. That being said, you should save it for a birthday or a special occasion where nobody cares too much about having to pay $50 for mains. ,It’s also a great spot for vegetarians because, thanks to the excellent salatim, you can come here and not have to worry about getting that sad broccoli dish or a dry veggie burger that looks like it’s made out of sponge. That's just another reason why we love Laser Wolf, and why our speech keeps getting longer by the day.  ,

"Sometimes you go to a music festival for a headliner and the opening acts surprise you. It’s like that one time we went to Made In America for Billie Eilish and subsequently heard a band led by a girl playing a recorder doing hip-hop covers. Even though we found some new songs we listen to in the shower, it didn’t come close to the excitement of seeing a star performer. ,At Bella Vista’s Fiorella, all of their pastas could be the headliner—not just on this menu, but at any Italian restaurant in the city. Things like tagliolini with clams, ricotta gnocchi, and rigatoni with sausage ragu will wow you, not to mention the appetizers are a pleasant surprise. ,
When you walk into this Italian spot, you’ll notice some of the antiques and remnants from the old space, like wooden piggy banks, an old metallic cash register, and the Fiorella Sausage butcher signage. But it’s not all throwback charm inside, as they have a giant and shimmering purple Venetian chandelier dangling in the middle of the dining space. Although, even with that kind of upscale fixture, a meal here is nothing like a fancy experience you’d get at their sister spot Vetri Cucina. The relaxed space inside only consists of a 14-seat bar and a few chairs along the walls. The cozy seating also means you have an intimate view of the chef flipping handspun tonnarelli in a creamy romano sauce or tossing rolled raschiatelli with chunks of guinea hen in bolognese.,It’s safe to go for two or three small plates and all of the pasta, especially if you’re with a group. Outside of the salad and fried mozzarella mounds, you should also go for the beef carpaccio that’s thinly sliced, briny, and comes served with perfectly charred beets. These opening acts get you ready for the pasta dishes you’ll pass around the table.,All of the pasta options range from $20-$25 and come with seasonally-changing sauces that rotate as often as the colors on Boathouse Row. No matter what options they have on the menu, they’ll be some of the best pasta you’ve had in your life. They do keep one dish on the menu regularly, their rigatoni with Fiorella sausage ragu, and it’s the best thing here. Plus, if you order their warm and fluffy focaccia bread, you can make a whole second meal out of sopping up any leftover pasta sauce. ,They’re open every day of the week, which is great because that’s how often you’ll probably get the urge to eat here. The covered outdoor seating makes it a place that’s perfect for anything, from a fun date night to a group meal. Because it’s so good, know that it’s somewhere that takes a bit of planning ahead (they often only have 4pm reservations available). But when you’re lucky enough to snag a reservation, you can just park up at an antique stool, eat an app or two, and taste some pasta that will get stuck in your head easier than a woodwind cover of “Mo Money Mo Problems.”

"As soon as you walk through the door of this Northern Liberties West African spot, you’re met with the scent of steaming jollof rice, plantains fresh out of the pot, buttery cornbread muffins, and the sound of chicken sizzling on the grill. It’s a sensation that we can’t put a price on, but they have, and it’s notably affordable (the bowls are $13 or under and each comes with a side). Suya Suya is a comfortable counter-service place to grab a quick meal in between a night out at the bars nearby or before catching a train from the Spring Garden station.,",/philadelphia/reviews/suya-suya,0.8713497687709282,512
"If you’ve lived in Philly for more than a day, you’ve had a cheesesteak. In fact, if you’ve been here for any significant amount of time, you probably have a ranking in your head of the top 10, which one has the softest bread, and where you can find the best cheese wiz. So when a restaurant puts a $140 cheesesteak on their menu, you can’t help but roll your eyes and wonder how anyone could ever justify dropping so much money on a sandwich. But that’s exactly what Barclay Prime did, and it’s the only place in the city that could—and does—get away with it.,Barclay Prime is a steakhouse right on the edge of Rittenhouse Square Park, and it goes big. Like a reality TV star planning an amusement park-themed birthday party for their one-year-old big. Like the city of Philadelphia after winning a Super Bowl big (okay, maybe not that big). But everything they do at this loungey, chandelier-filled spot is like a high-end circus that makes you feel like you’re related to Logan Roy. ,And nothing at Barclay Prime goes bigger than the food, which ranges from a raw bar (that includes an ounce of caviar for $250) to the cheesesteak and a special menu just for wagyu A5 steaks. While you might take one look at the menu and wonder how any piece of meat could be worth as much as a Sixers 100-level seats, one bite of the A5 wagyu filet that you can cut with just a spoon will change that. It’ll have you considering skipping a cable bill or two just to get the chance for one more meal here.,The cheesesteak is the other thing on the menu that’s non-negotiable because it’s the most quality cheesesteak you’ll ever have. It’s so good that you’ll wish you hadn’t even tried it because you probably spent the first half of dinner telling your friends how “there’s no way it lives up to the one at Ishkabibble’s,” especially after getting the speech about how the champagne brings out the flavor from the staff. Now you have to sit there silently and eat your words between sips. While you won’t be walking up to Barclay Prime and ordering a wiz wit on a Tuesday afternoon anytime soon, you’ll definitely be thinking about this sandwich the next time you’re in line at Jim’s for 30 minutes.,For all that is perfect and delicious at Barclay Prime, there is one huge downside: how expensive it is. You should be prepared to spend upwards of $200 per person for dinner here, but if you’re looking for the best steakhouse in Philadelphia, Barclay Prime is in a league of its own.,",/philadelphia/reviews/barclay-prime,0.8690861137487058,1090
"The family of Vetri restaurants is everywhere in Philly. When you’re looking to share a wood-fired pizza with a few friends, head to Pizzeria Vetri. If you need to eat the best pasta in the city that will make you more excited than Garfield when they’re near a plate of lasagna, spend the night at Fiorella. And when you want the crown jewel of the entire empire, where you can sit back and experience the best dining experience in Philadelphia, Vetri Cucina is the place to be. ,The Center City restaurant always delivers a night of excellent service that feels like a curated hospitality version of a Spotify playlist. You’ll feel like the center of attention, so much so that you may forget that anyone or anything else in the cozy spot exists at all. ,The $150 five-course tasting menu is more of a choose-your-own-fantasy adventure since every dish will remain in your thoughts days after your meal. It changes seasonally but the roadmap stays the same: pick a small plate, antipasto, pasta dish, and entree before getting your dessert. To begin with, you can expect (and you should go for) things like their sweet onion crêpe that’s essentially sticky caramelized strands of allium drenched in a creamy parmesan fondue. You should also try their savory Dungeness crab budino with asparagus bits floating in the thick broth and gets served with a flaky gnocco fritto that you can use to make the most lavish Hot Pocket ever. ,The pasta is the star of the show, though, especially because it’s the course with the most options (5) to choose from. But the corzetti with pistachio tarragon pesto and briny clam conserva is so good that we think about telling the host that’s the reason why we’re here (not for a birthday, anniversary, or any other appropriate time to come). With every course being as good as the last, it almost feels like you’re collecting Italian restaurant Infinity Stones after you finish each dish. By the end of your meal, your only wish when you snap your fingers will be to come back and repeat this dining experience over and over again.,If your bank account can’t handle that, save up and go to this place for a celebration that you have in bold on your calendar. When you do, get the wine pairing that runs an additional $135. While they have a bunch of options by the glass and bottle, the pairing comes with the special experience of hearing about the history between each wine—down to the grape types and stories about the producers.  ,
Beyond the great food, it’s the attentive service here that sets this restaurant apart. And that’s what makes it not only the best restaurant in the city, but a place where you would actually believe that there’s a genie in the kitchen granting life-fulfilling wishes in the form of the best dinner of your life.  ,",/philadelphia/reviews/vetri,0.8641319548892552,883
"When Bono sits down for dinner, we imagine him at the head of a long, mahogany table and being brought a 14-course meal of delicacies from around the world. If he doesn’t like what’s in front of him, he simply waves a hand and a team of waiters dressed in tuxedos removes the offending dish and replaces it immediately with something even more impressive, probably covered in edible gold flakes. While most of us will never experience anything quite this luxurious in our lives, dinner at Laurel gets you pretty close. ,Laurel is a 24-seat, tasting-menu-only restaurant on East Passyunk that serves some of the most creative and beautiful food in the city. When you tell people you made a reservation here, they act like you’ve been invited to some super-exclusive dinner party with the original cast of Hamilton. And while it’s a bit quiet and may feel overly formal and stuffy at times, as each dish comes out, you’ll soon realize that this is one of the best meals you can eat in Philadelphia.,The $135 six-course menu here is always changing and the food generally skews French, but each dish seems like it could be from a different part of the world. Whether it’s a simple piece of sea urchin with blood orange and finger lime that you’d expect from an excellent sushi spot or a tender slice of venison topped with mustard and a juniper jus, the seemingly contrasting flavors come together in ways that will make you want to go home and see what happens when you cover a duck with rhubarb and then dip it bee balm (which is on the menu). Each course also makes us think there’s someone in the kitchen whose title is something like “Food Architect” and all they do is find creative ways to put cod on a plate. You never know what your next dish might look like, and you’ll keep finding yourself staring at the kitchen door as if the next M. Night Shyamalan twist is right on the other side.,Depending on the night, you might see a row of oysters sitting on a bed of stones in a wooden box or a small bowl of soup topped with colorful drops in a spiral pattern that makes it look like an optical illusion, each of which is set in front of you and explained by someone who might as well be the curator of a modern art museum. They’ll tell you about each course in detail, and then disappear only to come back as soon as you finish the last bite of l’arpege egg and salty caviar and replace it with your next dish.,While most of the food at Laurel is truly excellent, every once in a while we’ll encounter a dish we don’t love. Maybe the snapper isn’t quite cooked right or the halibut comes off a little too harsh. But even in that rare instance, the staff will practically trip over themselves trying to make it right and make sure you leave happy with the three-hour marathon you just participated in.,Walking into a meal at Laurel is like arriving at a dinner party with a bunch of really important diplomats. You'll feel like you have to be on your best behavior, but if you can conjure up an occasion worthy of dropping over $100 for dinner (like an anniversary or a date night), there’s no better place to impress an out-of-towner or your partner of five years. We think Bono would approve if he ever made it here, but we already had the Taylor Swift eat in Philly a few times so we probably shouldn’t push our luck.,",/philadelphia/reviews/laurel,0.8577079337292879,1126
"Doing a lot things at once is hard. Doing a lot of things at once, and doing them all well, is nearly impossible. This is why we probably don’t see Oprah Winfrey refereeing an Eagles game between interviewing Obama and selling magazines. Vernick, however, manages to defy the odds. It’s a spot that, despite serving a bigger variety of food than you’ll find in Reading Terminal Market, does it all really, really well.,Vernick is the kind of restaurant we wish many other restaurants could be. It’s considered “New American,” but that term doesn’t really do it justice. Take one look at the menu and you’ll notice that literally every single dish is completely different from the one above and below it. It’s like being transported to Epcot in Disney World, except the food actually tastes good and you don’t have to deal with screaming children who want to ride Soarin’ for the seventh time. You’ve got a citrusy kanpachi crudo next to a red curry shrimp with kimchi rice and a jerk-rubbed pork chop next to a braised veal pot-au-feu. And every single dish, one after the other, gives you the same feeling you get when you finally remember the name of the movie you were thinking about, but couldn’t remember the name of for so long that everyone in the conversation lost interest—pure, unadulterated joy.,
,Because they conquer so many different dishes that are so different from each other, but also so good, it’s hard to believe that it’s one kitchen back there doing all of it. The other thing that’s hard to believe is how well the dishes mesh together. There’s always a point of your dinner where it feels like you have the entire UN represented on your table, but somehow it all works well together—even if the UN generally doesn’t.,Vernick also manages to pull off excellent multitasking with regards to their space, which is built to suit wildly different situations. It’s in a two-story building in Rittenhouse that looks like pretty much every other building around it and most of the bottom floor is outdoor and bar seating. This is perfect because, even though it can take a few weeks to get a reservation here, it’s generally pretty easy to walk in on a weeknight and sit downstairs or at the bar. The top floor, on the other hand, feels much more upscale. Up there, you’ll see most people on dates and, depending on the night, a few bigger groups celebrating a big birthday or third wedding. Because the space is so versatile, Vernick is usually one of those places you can pull out of your back pocket no matter the occasion.,We’re inclined to almost be annoyed with the fact that Vernick seems to pull off so many things so well, but really we’re just happy that they’re here for us. And that Oprah isn’t randomly throwing flags at The Linc and robbing the Eagles of touchdowns. ,",/philadelphia/reviews/vernick-food-drink,0.8033203380609222,863
"Friday Saturday Sunday is a small, two-story restaurant in Rittenhouse, and at a glance, it’s just like all of the other contemporary American spots in the city. The menu changes as often as AIM away messages did in 2004, but there are a few dishes that you’ll likely see, like at least one crudo and some pastas. It has the same beige color scheme and plates that look like they’re handmade, but are actually from Crate &amp; Barrel. Unlike most other places with similar menus, though, each dish at Friday Saturday Sunday is so perfectly executed that you’ll want to erase every other beef tartare and charred octopus you’ve ever eaten from your memory. Kind of like Matt Damon’s situation in The Bourne Identity, but ideally without the whole forgetting about your family and friends thing.,If the $130 tasting menu was the 76ers roster, any seafood dish would be Joel Embiid. Things like the halibut swimming in a citrusy lobster butter or cured arctic char with crispy nori and cucumber agua de chile are the real MVPs. And even though you’ve seen it done a million ways at a million different places, Friday Saturday Sunday has the New York strip steak down to a science. It’s charred on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside, the caraflex cabbage topping is crispy, and the sweet onion glaze coating is so good that you might start making friends with strangers at nearby tables just to see if they’ll part ways with any pieces of meat.,You definitely come here for the food, but you also go to Friday Saturday Sunday for the nightly party happening at the downstairs bar. It’s almost like they hire people to hang out here and laugh and talk to each other like they’re extras on a sitcom—because even if you walk in at 5pm, it’s always full, and it’s where you want to be when you come here. There’s a second-floor dining room that you have to make reservations for as well, but unless you’re trying to impress an out-of-town client or your high school fling who just got divorced, the bar is an easier and more casual place to eat the same great food and sip on a few refreshing cocktails.,Friday Saturday Sunday sticks out among the handful of other New American spots in the city for a few reasons: they’ve got excellent food, a bar area where you’ll always want to hang out, and they accomplish the almost impossible task of remixing dishes that you’ve seen a thousand times and somehow make them exciting again. ,",/philadelphia/reviews/friday-saturday-sunday,0.7910374239988398,422
"Pizza Shackamaxon in Fishtown is a casual place with a walk-up window that’s flanked by a handful of picnic tables. You can only get their thin-crust pizzas—unless you’re preordering four or more online—in-person and on the day of, and the slices are big enough to fill an entire plate, or hold with two hands. On most days, you’ll get to choose from plain, pepperoni, a thick tomato pie, and specialty slices like asparagus, sauteed radish, and ramp cream for $3-$5. No matter which you order, the slices are so big that you already feel pretty full after just one. But our favorite here is the tomato pie since the dough is soft and pillowy, and we’d happily eat the sweet and tangy sauce by the spoonful.  ,Any slice from Shackamaxon can spark more life into you than a cup of coffee, so head to this spot for pizza with perfectly charred dark dimple spots. We’re kind of happy you can’t get anything here on the delivery apps since waiting in line is part of the experience. Whenever you walk out with your order, everybody else in line gives you celebratory head nods as if to say, “Congrats, you just got some of the best pizza in the city.”,",/philadelphia/reviews/pizza-shackamaxon,0.7887011072366416,736
"There are some restaurants where you make a reservation and don’t give it a second thought until you get a reminder notification. There are other spots, though, where you start fantasizing and dreaming about your upcoming meal, similar to the way you start thinking about your wedding after watching Love Actually, as soon as you secure a table there. Zahav is very much the latter. ,
The Old City spot has been around since 2008, which shows by the dining room that kind of looks like a Cheesecake Factory. But there’s something uniquely impressive about a place that opened the same year Katy Perry released her first single, and still makes some of the best food in the city. ,At $72 per person, the rotating tasting menu always starts with trays of fluffy laffa bread, six vegetable salads like beets and charred eggplants (that are usually pickled), and creamy hummus. Each starting item is good enough that you could just pause the rest of the evening and make a meal of everything on the tray. But we suggest not stopping the procession of fried carrots topped with a pomegranate glaze, haloumi wrapped in crispy coconut strands, and grilled radishes coated with earthy chermoula. The only other place in the city you’ll find this type of food executed this well is at Zahav’s sister restaurants. And even so, our meals here have consistently been better than the ones we've had at Laser Wolf, Dizengoff, and Abe Fisher. ,You should expect small portions, but there are enough courses for two people to head home with a few leftover bags. And like a kid walking around Sam’s Club when they have free samples, you’ll want to try everything. We just suggest you save room for the well-executed mains like a tender lamb shoulder dripping with a pomegranate glaze that’s sitting on a bed of chickpeas or a spicy cauliflower pepper stew. Plus, they have a wine pairing for $45 that ties it all together. After hearing the staff talk about each bottle, you'll be so informed about wines from the Middle East that you’ll sound like a taped museum tour guide when you start rambling to your friends about Lebanese vineyards.,Like their Israeli grill counterpart in Kensington, Laser Wolf, you have to treat reservations at Zahav like Adele tickets and snap them up the minute something becomes available. But once you do, you'll have all the makings for an amazing date night or a weeknight dinner where you should take a few friends that you don’t mind sharing with. ,So yes, Zahav is worth all of the daydreams you’ll have before you arrive. Sure, you could try and walk in an hour before they open, or try to swing by later in the night to catch an open bar seat, but that would just take all the fun out of the waiting game.,",/philadelphia/reviews/zahav,0.8420595697693982,408
"Vedge is somewhere you can get perfectly charred carrots for your main course, have shallots diced and sprinkled in a garlicky soup, or drink celery blended in a bourbon cocktail. The plant-based restaurant that’s been around since 2011 seems like they’re constantly on a mission to prove that vegetables have more utility than a universal remote. And while we no longer think Vedge is one of the best restaurants in town, it's still a place where it's easy to have a good meal that will always leave you satisfied.,The food is the only aspect that has taken a slight step back in the past few years. Vedge still has the same wood floors, a cozy fireplace in the main dining space, and tables that are surrounded by colorful stained-glass windows. Because of this, you might think a meal at Vedge costs the same as a ticket to a Coachella. But with the most expensive entree going for $22, you can easily bring a few friends here for a birthday dinner without spending too much. It’s more than just the pricing and vegan menu that set this spot apart from the other Center City restaurants nearby though. They make dishes with whipped turnips and thin garbanzo crêpes that will make you slightly surprised that they can do all of this with the same vegetables you can get from a quick run to the market. ,You’ll want to go for a couple of small plates and three mains, especially since the portions run small. The dishes can range from light ones like smoked golden beets floating in a refreshing cucumber aquachile to heartier choices like their spicy dan dan noodles. Most of the elements on these plates complement each other really well, like the way the crunchy rice and the smooth avocado work in harmony in their stuffed avocado dish, or how the pastrami spice gives their grilled broccoli a peppery kick. ,Although the restaurant is often packed and some dishes look like the kind of things you’d find in Bobby Flay's upcoming vegetarian cookbook, the recent meals we’ve had here don’t have us thinking about them a few days later. Dishes like the grilled broccoli, fingerling potatoes, and campfire carrots come with glazes or sauces that add some garcliky and sometimes peppery flavor. But, unlike some of the other places that define eating in the city like Zahav or Vetri, we're not waking up the next morning thinking about mushroom carpaccio like we do when Rihanna drops a new photo. Because of this, dinner at this spot isn’t worth canceling your plans.,Even so, when coming to Vedge, you can always expect really good plant-based comfort food in a relaxed setting where you won’t have to struggle to book a reservation. It’s a key place to come for a casual meal if you’re vegetarian or vegan, or if your love for plants goes beyond the flower section of your local market. ,",/philadelphia/reviews/vedge,0.8408455439734273,52
"Our city hall is objectively the nicest looking city hall in the country (fight us, San Francisco), and there’s no better place to stare at it with a drink in your hand than Attico. The rooftop is right on Broad Street about a block south of William Penn’s personal balcony, and it’s basically a greenhouse full of plants surrounded by a big wraparound patio. With lounge couches, wicker hanging swing chairs, and a bar long enough to fit our favorites from the office for a Happy Hour, it feels like somewhere they would film the Real Housewives of Philadelphia (if that ever happened). They also have an open-air setup that makes it one of the more popular brunch spots in the city. Their menu includes things like fresh oysters, salads, creamy shrimp and grits, and a stacked burger that has melted fontina and a sweet oniony shallot jam covering every inch.

"As busy as Reading Terminal Market gets, you can still make out Beiler’s by the only spot with a line as long as Rita’s on the first day of summer. The Pennsylvania Dutch bakery sells baked goods like cinnamony coffee rolls and freshly brewed coffee, but it’s the donuts that get us (and the people) going. ,Each day they have up to 40 different varieties of these warm, light, fluffy, and airy circles of sweet dough. You can get them filled with syrupy blueberry jelly, sprinkled with some bits of M&amp;M’s, or go classic with vanilla sprinkled. No matter which one you order, after your first bite you’ll start wondering how much your parents really loved you as a kid if they sent you to school with a carton full of Munchkins on your birthday instead of these. Even now, we’d still only share these donuts on our birthday with loved ones who promise to give us a kidney if needed.,There’s no ideal time to come here, as we’ve tried to stop by in the early morning and in the late afternoon and the line is still unreasonable. But sometimes you just need one when you’re casually walking around downtown with some time to kill or you have an out-of-town friend who wants to know what makes the food in Philly so great. Take them here, give them a caramel apple donut, and watch them readjust their daily itinerary so they have an extra 20 minutes to wait in line for another one every day. ,

"Think of the classic sports films—Rocky, Friday Night Lights, Major League, and Rudy. While they’re all great, inspiring movies that make us feel good, they also tend to be repetitive and a little formulaic. Try to imagine a remake of Rudy where they tell the more realistic version of the story where nobody did the jersey thing, or the fact that carrying him off the field was actually a joke. No studio would sign off on that script.,Much like a classic sports movie, the food at Helm is somewhat predictable—which makes your experience here just a little bit less exciting than it could be. But just like watching an entire arena shout “Rudy,” a meal here will still make you feel warm and happy inside.,Helm is a New American BYOB that sits on a residential block in Kensington. The restaurant sources most of its ingredients locally and has a cozy dining room with a chalkboard menu that changes seasonally and features lots of radishes and turnips. There’s also a pleasant playlist in the background with indie up-and-comers that your coolest friend would give a half-hearted nod of approval to upon hearing.
,Despite feeling like you’ve seen all of this before, the food stands out from a lot of the other BYOBs around the city, and pretty much everything they serve will surprise you in a good way. There’s a delicious glazed carrot and beet dish drenched in a mole that looks like a bunch of orange mountain peaks poking through the clouds, creamy grits topped with tender chicken, and ravioli with peppers and lamb that reminds us of a deconstructed gyro in the best way possible.,Other dishes are good but forgettable—kind of like the fact that Vince Vaughn makes an appearance in Rudy as running back Jamie O’Hara. The bowl of squid, apple, and fennel has no distinctive flavor and there are scallops topped with cabbage that you’ll find yourself eating around to get a layer of buttery spaetzle that’s beneath it. But what you’ll notice is that those forgettable dishes only make up a small portion of the otherwise great $55 three-course tasting menu.,If you’ve been to one New American BYOB in Philly, you’ve basically been to them all. But if you live nearby Helm, then you should be thrilled. It’s a great place for a weeknight date or dinner with your family, and you can almost always get a last-minute reservation. You probably won’t cry from how moving your meal was like the end of Friday Night Lights, but you might leave feeling like you have a new restaurant to root for.,The menu changes often, but here are some dishes we’ve seen on our trips to Helm.,",/philadelphia/reviews/helm,0.8796801825681723,391
"When the snow starts falling, and we want to dive into a pub that could be the set of a few episodes of Peaky Blinders, we head to The Dandelion in Rittenhouse Square. But really The Dandelion really works any time of year. The bar is full of tartan bar seats, leather booths, and everything you’d expect from a throwback UK-themed bar—including the old paintings of hounds. They also have things like silver trays brought out for tea service and a menu full of English staples like Sunday roast, fish and chips, and a lamb shepherd’s pie that’s oozing with cheddar cheese. ,Bring your friends here for an afternoon tea that can be filled with scones, shortbread, or small sandwich options like curry chicken. Or you can stop by for a casual $6 pint during Happy Hour and some deviled eggs filled with sweet whipped madras curry. ,

"There are almost too many reasons why you should go to Middle Child Clubhouse: to eat big breakfast sandwiches, drink mezcal and beet cocktails, and get the opportunity to stare at pictures of Beyoncé and Princess Diana wearing Eagles gear. The Fishtown spot serves some of the most impressive breakfast and lunch sandwiches in Philly, and is one of the most exciting places to get a meal at night. It’s essentially an all-day hangout place with amazing food, and if we spend any more time here, they may start charging us rent.   ,The offshoot of the smaller Midtown Village shop, this younger sibling is full of cafeteria-style seating, table tops, counter seating, and long booths big enough for you and a few friends. During the day, it’s a good place to crank out some emails while looking out at Front Street, dive into a book while Kendrick Lamar cycles through the speakers, and bite into a stacked sandwich. ,When you come during the day, you should go right for the Hershel sandwich that has house-corned short rib, a row of fluffy eggs, and melted sharp cheddar cheese all on warm slices of rye. They also have hashbrowns, cinnamon buns, babka french toast, grab-and-go pastries, bagels, and a few other things to reward you for getting out of bed before noon. Lunch here runs until 2pm and the menu is full of deli and club sandwiches like a Reuben and the Baller Classic that combines thick-cut turkey, mayo, onion, and arugula. The best part is, whether you go for a breakfast or lunch sandwich, they’ll be piled high and taste like a sandwich version of a Cameo video where the guy who plays Stanley on The Office wishes you “happy birthday.” Basically, they’re perfect, and feel like they were made specifically for you any time you order one.,The sitdown experience of Middle Child really ramps up after 5pm, as it goes from a counter-service ordering to table service. Although this might seem like a casual place to grab a burger and fries, there’s nothing low-key about how memorable your dinner experience will be. At night, the music gets cranked up, the dining space gets as crowded as the BSL at 5pm, and you may see wine being poured down people’s throats with a long porron—you pretty much have all the elements from a few scenes from The Hangover. ,When it comes to the dinner menu, they have shareable plates like a crispy chicken caesar that comes with a breaded chicken milanese larger than Bigfoot’s shoe and the PEI mussels that are swimming in a wine sauce that we love so much, one of our friends yelled at us, “get a room” as we spooned it down. Going for a salad, two small plates, and then heading for one of the mains is the way to go—and that entree should absolutely be their burger. It’s thick and juicy, you’re only allowed to order it medium-rare or well-done, and it’s dripping in a homemade russian dressing and melted american cheese that makes each bite a tangy and creamy feast. 
,The wine and cocktail lists happen to have a ton of range, which makes this an even more versatile cafe. Sip on some French rosés, orange bottles from South Africa, a few Spanish reds, and apple wine from PA. With a lineup of cocktails on tap, you can start your Happy Hour early since they serve them all day.  
,Your experience at Middle Child can (and should) be a day-long journey from breakfast sandwiches in the morning to a night of burgers, games of pool with your friends, and multiple rounds of Chilean wine. And you’ll probably be left with the need to come back and do it all again the next day. ,",/philadelphia/reviews/middle-child-clubhouse,0.85468390643113,257
"This pan-Asian spot should be one of the first places you go when you’re in Center City and want to post up somewhere for Happy Hour. That's because Sampan has a few excellent dishes on the menu like edamame dumplings, cheesesteak bao, kung pao chicken, and shrimp pad Thai that you can bite into while sipping on $25 fish bowls that mix tequila, white wine, green tea, and grapefruit in one gigantic plastic cauldron.  ,This Midtown Village spot, which is from the same people behind Double Knot, specializes in small plates like buns, rolls, fried rice, and noodle dishes. And when you come for that Happy Hour after a long day at the office, you should focus on dishes like Kobe sliders, a chicken katsu boa with smoked mustard as cabbage, and kimchi fried rice for $6. The outdoor seating is open for every season, plus when you want to just drink and snack, you can just hop on into the alley and hit up Graffiti Bar since they've got the same menu. ,

"A trip to El Vez kind of feels like a ski trip you go on just to take some videos in front of the mountains, sit in front of the fire, and never actually hit the slopes. The Midtown Village spot has a solid atmosphere–brightly colored walls, a photo booth in the center of the dining room, and a shiny bicycle hanging over the bar. But it’s a place that you can only really rely on for mediocre Mexican food. ,That being said, we get why it’s one of the more popular places in the city. Any guacamole you try here can be slathered, coated, and plopped onto any entree and the dish will be upgraded. Try the bazooka limon–it’s peppery, has bits of pistachios in it, and the way the goat cheese blends with the avocado makes it one of the creamiest things you can add to any plate here. ,They have some other good things like buttery sweet corn empanadas, but you should avoid the enchiladas. They get no real memorable flavor from the mole or tomato sauces they’re drenched in, and you're better off focusing on their quesadilla dripping in chihuahua cheese. ,Most entrees here range from $25-$30 so it’s not an ideal spot to come and try a few plates and cocktails with a person you hardly know. But it can work for a few situations, like when you need somewhere to start your night before heading over to Vango—or for a fun night where you want to take endless selfies in their photo booth for your friend’s birthday.,

"Veda is an upscale spot in Rittenhouse that serves some of our favorite Indian food in the city. With a long u-shaped bar, several hanging chandeliers, and a few indoor trees, it’s somewhere that you can put on that new shirt you just brought and celebrate a birthday with a few people. 
,
The menu has a few small plates, biryani dishes, breads like naans and parathas for the table, and a couple of shareable mains you should go for. One is the thick Calcutta pork ribs that come coated with a chutney glaze, and the other is the lamb roganjosh. It's meaty and rich, though it’s worth asking for a little extra Kashmiri red peppers to take things up a notch—the default heat in the dish is about the same as a bag of Hot Cheetos. Another go-to is their goat cheese-stuffed naan, which is on both the Happy Hour and dinner menu. It’s something you’ll want to dip in every curry you eat, or just eat it on its own and wonder how you can make this bread a permanent fixture at every spot in the city. Plus, they’ve got one of the only truly bottomless brunches in Philly for $20 with things like masala egg toast and vegetarian thali, and it's one of the rare places that's open for both Monday lunch and dinner. ,They also have a great Happy Hour even on the weekends. From 5-7pm, you can get $9 cocktails like margaritas and Old-Fashioneds and small plates like samosa chaat, lamb donuts, and a tandoori grilled salad. Outside of those small plates that range from $4-$8, they have seats that overlook Chestnut Street so you can have a maharaja tonic and some lamb biryani while watching the rest of the world go about its day.

",Sometimes it’s nice to let somebody else take care of you. Even if it’s just for an evening, it feels great to forget about everything you should be worrying about, like filing your taxes and canceling that 14-day free trial before you’re charged. How about instead of thinking about all that, you get served some of the best sushi and Japanese food in Philadelphia while simultaneously being pampered like you’re a celebrity’s five-pound pomeranian? That’s what you’ll be in for at Hiroki, a small omakase-only spot in Fishtown.,Since there’s only one option for dinner, a nine-course omakase that’s $155 per person, you’ll only need to make two decisions before you enjoy your night of luxury. The first is whether to sit at the sushi bar or a regular table. At Hiroki, half of the experience is watching the sushi chef up-close slice 10 identical pieces of fatty toro. You’ll want to have a front-row seat at the sushi bar—sitting at a normal table is like paying the same price everyone else does for a Bruce Springsteen concert, but choosing to sit in the nosebleeds and watch him do ”Born To Run” through binoculars. It’s just not worth the cost.,The second and final decision you have to make is whether you want to add the optional $65 sake pairing. You can certainly have a good meal without it, but if you want the full Hiroki experience, we recommend getting the sake pairing—especially since your glass seems to magically refill itself with rice wine every few minutes. At $210 with the pairing, it’s a meal about the cost of your cable bill with all of the premium movie channels, but it’s not a bad value compared to other fancy omakases in town. At most high-end sushi spots with a preset menu, a “course” really just means one piece of fish. But at Hiroki, each course is broken down into multiple different plates—meaning by the time you leave, you’ll have eaten over 20 different items ranging from a piece of mackerel nigiri to crispy tilefish to miso soup.,Everything you eat at Hiroki will be delicious, like the zensai (appetizer course) which consists of four small bowls, each filled with a few ingredients that can all be eaten in one bite. You might have a quail egg in a soy vinaigrette, and another dish of a pickled bamboo shoot or some cured abalone. The best bite of food, though, is a sweet and tender piece of medium-rare wagyu steak marinated in soy, topped with a sprinkle of sea salt. It’s so good, you almost don’t want them to take your plate away after you’ve finished the last remaining grain of salt on the plate. But as soon as you’re done, your plates are whisked away and get seamlessly replaced with something new and just as good.,On any normal night, you could probably have a cup of coffee and go home full and ready for bed. But after the steak, you still get to eat 12 pieces of nigiri that range from thinly-cut snapper to barracuda, all served with a soy wash and dot of wasabi, plus an uni hand roll, a square shrimp and egg tamago, miso soup, and fluffy strawberry roll cake for dessert.,During your meal, the staff makes you feel like you’re a bigger deal than Allen Iverson. You’re served, fed, and fawned over like a gout-ridden, 17th-century king. For a couple of hours, your only responsibility in the world is to eat excellent sushi—at least until you have to go home to change your Brita filter and pick up the dry cleaning.,Your only choice is the nine-course omakase that begins with four small appetizer bowls and ends with a strawberry shortcake roll. But everything that’s included in the meal, about 20-or-so plates, is excellent. Below are some examples of things you might see.,",/philadelphia/reviews/hiroki,0.8406062766621853,521

The shop on South Street is one of the bigger locations, and it’s a great spot to grab a quick BEC with a chocolate toffee donut before heading into the office—or if you’re at Tattooed Mom nearby and realize there’s nothing sweet on the menu. ,,",/philadelphia/reviews/federal-donuts,0.878738163937839,3

But just because Philly is the place to get them, that doesn’t mean anyone should settle for sandwich mediocrity—and no one does them better than this Roxborough staple. The thing that sets the steaks here apart, outside of the perfectly soft bread and premium cuts of beef, is the variety. Every topping here is free, so you can take your buffalo chicken cheesesteak to inferno levels with crushed hot peppers or smother your cheesesteak hoagie with marinara (no judgement).

"One too many drinks in at your last party, you felt inspired and announced, “I’m going to open a bar one day, fill it with everything we like, and the people will flock to it, deeming me lord of Fishtown and purveyor of all that is good.” And though no one took you too seriously, you’ll realize when you get to Martha that someone already got the jump on you.,Martha is a bar/restaurant on the border of Fishtown and Kensington that looks like if someone bought a small warehouse and then just filled it with eclectic furniture that they got from a few estate sales and called it a day. There are worn-in couches and armchairs next to an old-fashioned stove fireplace, and a bunch of mismatched tables lined up around the perimeter. Projectors display movies from the 1960s on one wall, and the extensive food and drink menu on another. In the middle of the space is a huge bar with at least 25 seats that always seems to be full of friends meeting up for cocktails (most of which are less than $12) and a hoagie waffle topped with salami, provolone, and long hot pesto that’s just as delicious as it sounds.,Other than the hoagie waffle, Martha’s food menu is full of bar snacks that are surprisingly creative - like the magic mushrooms, which is a bowl of maple maitake mushrooms over squash grits and topped with their homemade hot sauce. There’s also a whole section of hoagies (our favorite is the perky turkey), and a mix-and-match charcuterie plate that pairs well with pretty much any third drink of the night. It’s the kind of food you can easily split with a date or a couple of friends.,Stop by for dinner at the bar and if it’s a season where being outside isn’t dangerous to your health, grab another drink and head out back to play some bocce ball on the huge patio.

"The year is 2011, and the Eagles’ season is about to start. They’re coming off three straight playoff seasons, and they’ve recently signed a bunch of superstars - Nnamdi Asomugha, Jason Babin, and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie to name a few. Their own players are calling themselves the “dream team.” By all accounts, it’s their year to win the Super Bowl. ,They didn’t. In fact, they didn’t even make the playoffs. They totally and completely sucked. It didn’t make any logical sense, and no one could figure out why it happened. The fans did what they always do - they yelled, pelted Santa Claus with snowballs, and held up signs saying things like “Post Reid’s job on Craigslist.” ,The disappointment we felt during that season is exactly how we feel now about Aether, a seafood restaurant in Fishtown - it has all the makings of a great restaurant but just isn’t.,Considering the people behind Aether have two great restaurants in the suburbs, there’s no reason why this place should be any different. Everything - from the interior design to the company’s experience running successful restaurants - says it should be. When you walk into Aether, you feel good about where the night’s going. The space is aesthetically pleasing, the wine list is well-curated with lots of natural stuff, and the long bar up front is full of people who look like they’re having a decent time.,The problem here is what’s coming out of the kitchen. As good as the menu looks - with things like Spanish octopus, crab linguine, and crispy fried whole branzino - every dish is poorly executed or has major flaws. There’s a delicious-sounding hamachi crudo with leche de tigre, quinoa, avocado, and chili oil that tastes like absolutely nothing. The undercooked scallops sit in a green curry sauce that doesn’t complement them at all. And then there’s the shrimp toast, which comes piled high with so many different things that it weighs down the entire dish, turning it into a soggy mess. All of these dishes have a bunch of great ingredients that just don’t work together.,It’s especially unfortunate because Fishtown needs a good seafood restaurant, and this should have been it. However, no matter how many times we go, and how many different things we try, none of the dishes work. It’s a team that looks good, and should be able to execute, but can’t seem to get any of the pieces to work together. ,If you do end up here for a first date or to catch up with a friend, sit at the bar and split a bottle of wine and a seafood tower - because everything the kitchen doesn’t overthink is great. The raw bar has a big selection of East and West Coast oysters, the wine list has a great bottle of skin-contact wine we’d buy by the case if we could, and all of the cocktails are solid. ,But besides drinks and a few oysters, Aether is pretty much useless. Just like the 2011 Eagles (and, really, most Eagles seasons), it will go down on a long list of Philly things that should be great, but just aren’t.",/philadelphia/reviews/aether,0.8497913854777996,1338
"Imagine a graph that charts your dinner mood. On one axis is how much money you want to spend and on the other is your level of laziness. If your laziness is high and you’re willing to spend a lot, you might go out for a nice steak and some wine. If your laziness is low and you’re saving up for a box of Dunkaroos from 1994 that you found on Ebay last week, you might stay home and mess up a recipe that your coworker told you was foolproof. But if you’re feeling particularly lazy, and also have no money to spend, you should probably head over to Hardena, where your whole meal will be less than $10 and way better than the takeout you usually succumb to. ,Hardena is a small Indonesian cafe in South Philly that you’ve probably walked by 12 times without realizing it. They serve a combination of mostly stewed dishes over rice that change daily and only have a few tables for dining in. No matter what you get here, it’s going to be really excellent, but the beef rendang is the first thing you should ask for. It’s braised and marinated in coconut milk to give it the perfect, tender texture and tons of flavor, and it’s almost always on the menu (unless you go too late at night and it’s sold out). The collard greens are another one of our favorites, but beyond that, just ask the staff for their favorites and you won’t go wrong. In total, you’ll pay less than the cost of the Uber you took to get here, and you can either sit down for the 15 minutes it will take you to eat your food or take it home to eat while you cram for an 8am presentation the next morning.,So if you’re dealing with one of those dinner situations where you think your only options are delivery pizza or ramen that will likely have soaked through the bag and made everything else sticky by the time it gets to you, just know that you have Hardena.

It has the very casual vibe of a diner, but likely the same interior designer we imagine comes to the United States just to laugh at us for paying her to put subway tile on restaurant walls and call it “Australian.” ,Either way, Middle Child has some of the best breakfast sandwiches around, and you’ll probably wait at least 30 minutes one on the weekend. It ’s also a popular spot for Jefferson doctors and med students during the week, so if you want to grab a phoagie (an eggplant sandwich with avocado, bean sprouts, and something called pho sauce that we’d eat on anything), you’re going to need to time your visit for right before their shift change.",/philadelphia/reviews/middle-child,0.8762262758728544,913
"When you walk into Blue Corn, you’ll immediately think it’s a major holiday that you somehow forgot. There’s shiny red garland with pink hearts hanging over the bar, cardboard spiders dangling from the ceiling, and everyone’s already on their second margarita. Then you remember that it’s just a random Tuesday night and the next major holiday isn’t for three months. That’s what’s so great about Blue Corn though. No matter when you come here, it feels like you’re celebrating a holiday - a holiday with really solid tacos.,Blue Corn is a small, 10-table Mexican restaurant in the Italian market and it’s one of the best places to go when you want a fun night out that starts with good margaritas and great tacos. Everything here, from the two semi-spicy salsas that appear on every table to their blue corn tortillas that form the base of most of their tacos, quesadillas, and huaraches, is made in the small, open kitchen. And while most of the food here is fairly familiar, you’ll also see ingredients like nopales and beef cheeks that you won’t find at many other taco spots in the city.,Besides tacos, the menu includes everything from soups to tortas to filet mignon, but the blue tacos al pastor are sweet, rich, and hands down the best thing here. The ceviches are equally impressive, especially the one with octopus, avocado, and pico de gallo that’s topped with homemade vinegar. Whether you get that one or the daily special ceviche, it’ll come with plantain chips and a honey-lime salsa that is just a bit spicy, mostly sweet, and unlike any salsa we’ve ever had. You’ll want to confiscate all of it and bring it home to pour on anything and everything you own - edible or not. ,While the appetizers and tortilla-focused dishes are all nearly perfect, the entrees aren’t quite as exciting. Some things are a little bland, like the chicken mole, and the pork chops are flavorful, but a bit too tough. If you come with a group, the camarones al ajillo and the filet mignon covered in beans and melted manchego are both worth ordering, especially if the idea of delicious meat and cheese snugly sleeping inside blue tortilla blankets isn’t cutting it for some reason.,As long as you know what you’re getting yourself into - namely more than a few drinks and sitting by at least one table of people talking over each other about something from college that no one 100% remembers - you’ll have a good time at Blue Corn. Even if you had to create a fake holiday like Vice Presidents Day or Chuck E.

"If you walked into Perla on a random night, you’d probably enjoy yourself. You’d split a few shared plates and a bottle of wine, comment on how small and intimate the dining room is, and when you left, you’d store it in your brain as a good date night spot for when you’re in the neighborhood. You probably wouldn’t immediately group message everyone you know in a five-mile radius and demand that they clear their schedules to go here. Unless you came on a night when they serve their kamayan feast, which is when eating at Perla is one of the most unique dining experiences in the city. ,Every Wednesday and Sunday, the tables at this Filipino BYOB in East Passyunk are pushed together and covered with banana leaves, and the quiet couples you normally see here are replaced with big, animated groups of friends eating with their hands from communal piles of food. First, a layer of fried rice is spooned onto the table in a formation that looks like one of those perfectly symmetrical mountain ranges from a Wes Anderson movie. Next, vegetables - brussels sprouts, carrots, bok choy, onions, and peppers. And then a whole fried fish, pieces of crispy pork belly, spring rolls, and lemony whole chickens are stacked on top of the rice and vegetable wall. Finally, a few different sauces are scattered around the table, so you can mix and match to create what seems like an infinite number of combinations out of everything in front of you.,And it’s these combinations that make the feast so delicious. One minute it may be a piece of crispy pork belly dipped into a vinegary and sweet dressing, and the next you’re pouring a spicy, harissa-like red sauce over a bite of chicken breast and bok choy. It’s like a choose-your-own-adventure book, except all of the endings to the kamayan feast are happy ones in which you end up very full, likely with your hands covered in olive oil and rogue rice grains.,This is when Perla really shines, and despite feeling a bit uncomfortable at first, eating with your hands from a giant pile of food forms a bond between everyone around the table. But on the nights when everything is a la carte, this is completely lost. The tables are broken down into two-tops, and most people are there to split a bottle of wine with a date. It’s definitely a different scene, but it’s still worth coming here if you’re in the area and looking to share a few dishes, like the short rib kare kare or Spanish octopus. However, neither the food nor the experience measures up to what you’ll get from the kamayan feast. ,And that’s because the kamayan feast is the main show here, even though it only happens twice a week. It creates a connection that lasts long after the dinner is over, and it’s one that you won’t get from any other spot in town.",/philadelphia/reviews/perla,0.8653923947358904,885
"Parc is a special place - partially because we think it’s slowly fused into Rittenhouse Square’s permanent architecture, and also because you can pull it out of your back pocket for pretty much any situation. It’s a classic French bistro with a classic French bistro menu (think steak tartare and duck l’orange), and while none of their food comes with table-side magic tricks, everything is fresh and delicious. They also have some of the best sidewalk seating in the city, so if you’re in the mood to watch people walking their dogs who look just like them, this is the place to be.",/philadelphia/reviews/parc-brasserie,0.8009150622017365,903
"The Han Dynasty in University City serves two main purposes - a place to get some of the best Sichuan food around, and a full-on sports bar to watch whatever game happens to be on TV. The dan dan noodles are our favorite thing here, and they’re pretty spicy, but if you’re not into that you can ask them to take down the heat. There are also about 50 other things on the menu that you can enjoy while you watch the Flyers lose their 47th game in a row.",/philadelphia/reviews/han-dynasty-1,0.7914435748688431,1352

"It’s hard to predict exactly who will show up to a group dinner. Something that started out as you inviting three close friends to catch up often results in one of them dropping out last minute, another suggesting to fill her place with her kickball teammate, and the third bringing along his new boyfriend without even running it by the group. But regardless of how well you know the people at the table, you can be sure that it won’t be an uncomfortable experience if you have dinner at Abyssinia. ,And that’s because Abyssinia, an Ethiopian place in University City, is basically awkward-dinner-proof.,There are a few ways you can approach a meal here, but the best route is to focus on the combination platters, each of which comes out looking like a giant edible watercolor palette and can be shared by at least two people. Things like doro wot (spicy chicken in a rich berbere sauce), yebeg qey wot (tender lamb in a puddle of garlicky stew), and ye’kik alicha (oniony yellow split peas) come out in messy but delicious piles on top of spongey injera bread that would make a heavenly mattress topper. In between breaking off pieces of injera with your hands and using it to scoop up different flavors, you’ll inevitably become closer with the people you’re sharing food with. So much so that it can make a dinner that started out with the ice breaker, “So how do you feel about Daylight Savings?” turn into one where you’re giving someone you just met your HBO Go password.,The entire restaurant is just a single, small-ish room with wood paneling, faded wallpaper, and a few Ethiopian tapestries and paintings hung on the walls. It’s warm, casual, and constantly filled with people - which makes meeting your friend’s boyfriend for the first time somehow feel less intimidating. And once dinner’s over and you’ve met someone who hates musicals as much as you do, it’s a pretty seamless transition to the small upstairs bar, Fiume. The worn-in room with peeling paint on the walls and a few uneven barstools is intentionally divey, and you can get some drinks here that are interesting without being pretentious, like a take on a sloe gin fizz and the Abyssinian, with a mix of rum, lime, Batavia arrack, and fernet.,On an average night, there are maybe one or two people on the entire Abyssinia waitstaff, which means you might wait a few extra minutes for your beef tibs. But that just gives you extra time to get to talk to your new friends - even if your original intentions were to put on your Big Daddy sunglasses and pretend to be invisible. By the time the check comes, there’s a high chance you’ll actually like the people around you (and about a 20% chance that your friend’s kickball teammate genuinely has a bad personality). And since everything is shared, there won’t be any arguing over who pays for what. Unless, of course, one of the random people you didn’t even invite wants to tally up how many bites of injera everyone took. In that case, maybe get some hard commitments next time.",/philadelphia/reviews/abyssinia,0.8768420970467153,763

Now, though, they serve some of the better food in the area. It’s got a gastropub feel that’s nice enough to bring your parents when they’re in town, but not so nice that you can’t imagine your grandfather ripping shots with his buddies 20 or so years ago.

"If we made a flowchart on whether or not you should go to Harper’s Garden, it would have one simple question: Is it nice outside? If the answer is no, then there are a bunch of other places we’d recommend instead. But if the answer is yes - if the sun is shining and the temperature is 70 or above - then there’s only one place you should be going for a post-work glass of wine and a few small plates. And that place is Harper’s Garden.,Harper’s Garden is located between Rittenhouse Square and almost every Center City office building, and it’s about 75% patio and 25% indoor space. During the winter, there’s almost no reason to come here, because if Harper’s Garden were La La Land, then the patio would be the combination of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Take it away and you’re left with a depressing two-hour saga inside a small, empty bar area that’s devoid of almost any atmosphere. However, as soon as May hits, all of a sudden every single person you know, from your upstairs neighbor to that person you always see at your coffee shop, is waiting in line for a table under the plant-covered trellis here.,You generally don’t come to Harper’s Garden for the food - you come to hang out in the nice weather after a long day of work with the few people you can still tolerate talking to. But when you don’t want to have three drinks on an empty stomach, stick to the small plates. There’s a kung pao squid dish with Szechuan peanut sauce with exactly the right amount of heat and sweetness to it, oysters with a raspberry vinaigrette that are a no-brainer if you’re sharing with the table, and a tomato and prosciutto pie that’ll go well with whatever drink you happen to be on. It’s all stuff that can be easily divided among a group of people, which is exactly what you want from a place that you’re mostly going to because the weather’s good and it happens to be close to everyone’s office.,The burger is also a solid option if you want something bigger, and at $14 it’s a much better deal than anything you’ll pick from the larger plates - which are generally underwhelming and overpriced. But we’re kind of okay with that, because Harper’s Garden fills a very specific outdoor-drinks-and-small-plates void in Philly, and they do it well. Which is why we don’t need to make a flowchart that looks like the SEPTA map to decide whether you should go here. Just check your weather app, float the idea to your other three coworkers who leave at exactly 5:01pm every day, and save the more complicated flowcharts for later in the night.",/philadelphia/reviews/harpers-garden,0.869748942912526,882
"Apparently back in the 1700s when most of Old City was built, rooftops weren’t quite as hot a commodity as powdered wigs were, so you won’t find too many of them in the area. One of the only exceptions is Revolution House, a second-floor “rooftop” that’s basically just an elevated dining room, but it’s the best place in the area to hang out with a few beers and some bar snacks when the weather is in that 10-degree range that’s actually pleasant. The views aren’t exactly panoramic, but that really just means there won’t be a ton of tourists asking you to take their picture.",/philadelphia/reviews/revolution-house,0.8755878396067559,860

"First dates are one of the world’s greatest wonders. Much like Stonehenge and all-inclusive family vacations, they’re a ton of work to coordinate and prepare for, and they’re usually kind of a letdown once you get there. Besides sustaining at least an hour of conversation with someone you likely have almost nothing in common with, you also have to pick a place to meet that’s dark enough to will any semblance of a spark into existence, but casual enough that the server won’t ask you if you’re celebrating anything special, rendering both of you speechless.,Nunu is a Japanese izakaya in Fishtown that’s equal parts sexy lounge and casual bar with food, and it works really well for a low-key first date - whether it’s just for drinks or a full meal. We say “sexy lounge” not because we’re club promoters making a loud and obnoxious poster to put up on every telephone pole in the city, but because there’s really no better way to describe it. Everything is red, from the lighting and two-person booths built into the wall to the Japanese lanterns hanging above the bar, and it feels like a place that should have a DJ booth in the corner and bartenders taken from the cast of a poorly-produced Bravo show. Fortunately, the music is generally a good mix of Destiny’s Child and other early 2000s songs that you can easily talk over, and the bartenders aren’t bathing in a sea of Axe body spray.,While none of the food at Nunu will cause you to tell your friends to eat here immediately, it’s perfectly fine for a casual dinner at the bar. There are a range of small plates like hot wings with tahini and cucumber and $3 yakitori skewers, along with a few larger items like katsu sandwiches and curry plates. The pork katsu “sando” is probably our favorite thing here - half because of the fluffy milk bread and the cabbage coleslaw it’s topped with, and half because the fries it comes with taste just like the ones from McDonald’s (in a very good way). There are other things we don’t love, though, and on a menu with only about 15 dishes, everything counts. The beef tartare, for example, has a little too much happening on it with mustard and kimchi, and the yakitori skewers are very hit or miss. ,So the next time you’re chatting with someone on whatever app you use to find suitable life partners, suggest meeting them at Nunu. You’ll likely have a perfectly fine meal, some good drinks, and even the choice to sit outside in the little alley between Nunu and Cheu next door. And if it doesn’t go as well as you’d like, you can always bring home your leftovers and watch a Netflix documentary about the seven wonders of the world on your couch.",/philadelphia/reviews/nunu,0.8765199877478478,547
"DanDan is a good weekday lunch or post-work spot if you happen to work nearby in Rittenhouse, and they also have a reasonably priced Happy Hour (which unfortunately ends at 6pm). But if you’re able to get a seat at the bar before then and don’t mind rubbing elbows - literally - with other Center City diners, we’d advise ordering one of each of the baby DanDan noodles, the dry-seasoned chicken wings, and the spicy crispy cucumbers. ,Considering it’s located in the middle of Rittenhouse, it’s not surprising that DanDan is on the smaller side, and seating options are tight. Call ahead if you’re with a group (or consider getting your noodle fix at one of the larger Chinatown establishments). If you go in expecting an entire menu of familiar Taiwanese and Szechuan cuisine, you might be disappointed.

"When we say “power lunch,” what comes to mind? Probably a group of men in suits (with very pronounced shoulder pads), those credit cards made of metal instead of plastic, and a bunch of nonsensical phrases like “let’s square the circle” and “we’ve got it covered from soup to nuts.” When you imagine these kinds of events taking place, you probably envision them happening at a place like Butcher &amp; Singer, where important people talk business over a very expensive meal.,Butcher &amp; Singer is one of the many steakhouses near Rittenhouse Square, but unlike all the others within a five-block radius that look more like dining rooms at expensive retirement homes than anything else, Butcher &amp; Singer feels like a clubhouse straight out of The Great Gatsby. Before the bone-in filets and seafood towers, there was a bank here, and it still feels like you could walk into Butcher &amp; Singer and ask for $100 in pennies without anyone batting an eye. The servers wear tuxedos and use phrases like “excite your palate” to describe the tuna tartare. It’s all a bit over-the-top, but it’s what makes Butcher &amp; Singer one of the more unique restaurants in the city.,The menu is about as classic as a steakhouse menu can get. There’s a raw bar with a $145 shellfish platter, appetizers like onion soup and steak tartare, and enough steak and side options to get you through a nuclear apocalypse. The steaks are all served simply with a salty dry rub at the perfect temperature, and although they’re all delicious, the porterhouse should be your top priority - it’s best when you “add Oscar” (a combination of asparagus, lump crab, and bearnaise sauce). They’re also open for lunch, and if you find yourself here for a midday meal with a few coworkers or a bunch of lawyers you want to keep on retainer for any future issues you may have, the only thing better than the steaks is the butcher burger. It’s always perfectly cooked, and topped simply with cheddar cheese and fried onions. ,Some of the food is less impressive though, especially considering how expensive it all is. The supposedly exciting tuna tartare is bland, and the brussels sprouts taste like the ones you pushed around your plate until you were excused from the dinner table as a kid. In general, there’s nothing so good that you’ll be rushing to come back - besides maybe the bacon mac or the burger. But if you happen to get a metal card in the mail and are looking for somewhere to earn triple points on dining, Butcher &amp; Singer is a good place to rack them up while pretending you’re the leader of the free world.",/philadelphia/reviews/butcher-and-singer,0.8854103297709419,302

It comes on a hoagie roll with roast pork, provolone, broccoli rabe, and long hots—and John’s Roast Pork makes a perfect one.

"Here’s a fun game to play the next time you run out of dinner conversation topics: What would you do if you were a passenger on the sinking Titanic? Crowd the decks and try to get into one of the few lifeboats on board? Swim for it and maybe hoist yourself onto a floating door that, years later, people on Twitter will deem big enough to fit two people? Or do what the captain did and just find the nicest room on the boat to hang out in while everyone else panics?,If it were us, we’d grab some abandoned, expensive champagne, maybe light up a pipe, and head to the ship’s library for a final blowout. We’ll never know exactly what that would have been like - but dinner at Alpen Rose feels close.,Once you’re inside this sort-of-hidden steakhouse in Midtown Village, sandwiched between two much larger, flashier restaurants, you get the sense you’re far away from civilization. Like, maybe, on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic, heading towards an iceberg. But, if there were some sort of looming danger in the world outside, you’d have no idea - because everyone here is splitting $100 porterhouses, drinking cocktails, and generally not worrying about whatever is happening outside the four walls of the restaurant.,While the menu is overall what you’d expect to find at an expensive steakhouse, with things like mashed potatoes and a shrimp cocktail, most of our favorite things are the smaller plates. The beef tongue, for example, is a must-order. Instead of your standard steakhouse beef carpaccio, this is like a deconstructed pastrami sandwich, with russian dressing, sauerkraut, and rye croutons. The bone marrow toast is also excellent, and comes topped with beef cheek soaked in a red wine sauce - you scoop the bone marrow on top of it like it’s a savory ice cream sundae. And the buttery, salty parker house rolls are so good you won’t even care if the ship you’re on is going down.,The steaks are broken down into two sections - the first of which is “steaks, chops and poultry” - but you should focus on the dry-aged beef portion of the menu. There are six options, ranging from a $47 New York strip to a $125 tomahawk, and what you should order mostly depends on how many people are at your table. If you’re with a big group splitting a bunch of plates, go for the tomahawk. It’s tender, salty, and sliced tableside so you don’t have to worry about cutting up 45 ounces of meat for everybody at your table.,At the end of the day, Alpen Rose is still a steakhouse, but it’s an alternative to the traditional, large, clubby kind that is all too common in Center City. It’s small - almost cozy if you can imagine that from a steakhouse - and it’s a place to celebrate, whether it’s a milestone birthday or just to meet up with a few friends and ask them weird questions about a boat that sank a hundred years ago.",/philadelphia/reviews/alpen-rose,0.8631965520531143,570

"We’re taught from a young age that you should always choose the tougher path when given the option. “Take the road less traveled” and “If it doesn’t hurt, it isn’t working” were printed on poster-sized Shutterstock photos and plastered to the walls of every elementary school. But we think sometimes it’s not only okay, but a totally valid option, to choose the easy course. In fact, we might even make our own motivational poster that says, “Taking the easy way out is okay sometimes, Mrs. Keffer” and hang it up in the cubicle we share with three other people who also gave up on their dreams to sell PVC pipe for a living.,L’anima is an Italian BYOB in Grad Hospital, and on any given night, it’s an easy option. It’s more modern and spacious than most other Italian BYOBs in the city, they serve great pasta, and you can almost always get a table without a reservation. Plus, it’s one of the first legitimate restaurants in an area that’s just starting to become a place where people actually want to hang out. Will you leave feeling like you just had an unforgettable experience that you want to shout about from a rooftop? Probably not. But on most nights, you’re not looking for that anyways. You’re just looking for a good place to bond with a few friends as you recount every time you’ve ever called someone by the wrong name. On those nights, L’anima is where you want to be.,L’anima is from the same people as Melograno, and it has a similar concept: Italian comfort food that focuses heavily on pastas and classic antipasti dishes with ingredients like pesto and mozzarella. The only notable difference with L’anima is that you’ll see a lot more seafood on the menu than at Melograno, like a swordfish skewer appetizer that’s served over garlic bruschetta and topped with salsa verde. It’s the best antipasti on the menu, and you should get it even if swordfish isn’t your favorite weapon-themed fish. ,Where the food really shines, though, is in the pasta section, which includes a mix of traditional and modern options, and they’re all great. But if you have to choose just a couple, the vaccinara and the cacio e pepe are the way to go. The vaccinara is pappardelle tossed with a braised oxtail ragu, and you’ll likely be scraping the sauce off the plate even after the pasta is long gone. And the cacio e pepe is exactly what you’d expect from a cheesy, peppery pasta, but the al dente noodles and creamy, light sauce make this the one dish we’d place a repeating daily order for if any delivery company offered that service.,The rest of the menu, which consists of Roman-style pizzas called pinsas and a few entrees, is fine, but you could pretty much fold the menu in half right after the pasta section, and you wouldn’t miss out on much. It’s not that the rest of the food is bad, it’s just that if you want a pizza, you’d be better off going to a slice shop on South Street, and if you want a steak, we’d recommend one of the dozens of steakhouses that inhabit every other building in Rittenhouse.,We’re not here to step all over the idea that you should choose the harder route - there’s a time and a place for creating a 13-step plan to get the toughest reservation in town. But on most nights, it’s more enjoyable to throw your kindergarten teacher’s lessons to the wind and just go eat some great cacio e pepe.",/philadelphia/reviews/lanima,0.8604946299819781,311

That’s kind of like what A Mano is to every other Italian BYOB in Philly. Everything they do seems effortless, from the upscale, but still somehow casual feel of the dining room to the food, which tastes like it was made in a back-alley kitchen in Florence, but looks like the stuff you’d find in the most expensive and technical restaurants in the city.

"There are a few reasons why you tend to save omakase experiences for special occasions. These multi-course meals usually cost a lot. They will likely involve servers wearing coordinated, freshly-pressed outfits who refill your water glass after every sip. And, in general, they’re elaborate meals where you feel the need to photograph every course that’s put in front of you, as if you’re going to string together a slideshow of photos that live as your laptop background for eternity.,The omakase at DAWA on the other hand, is something you could have tonight. This small, BYOB sushi and ramen shop under the El in Fishtown isn’t as polished as traditional omakase - but its more approachable elements make it great for a casual weeknight dinner.,The restaurant is split into two separate experiences. There’s a room with a few tables where people are ordering things like shoyu ramen and yellowtail handrolls. And then there’s a seven-seat sushi bar, where the owner of the place serves a few 15- to 24-piece omakase meals per day, all by himself. ,That omakase is why you come here. There are better places to get ramen, and cheaper places to get a basic sushi roll, but DAWA is the best place in the area to get an omakase when you don’t want to dress up or think about your posture every 52 seconds. On most weeknights, it’s $59 for a 15-piece omakase, but sometimes they decide to randomly switch to a $100 omakase that can have up to 24 pieces. So if a lower-commitment meal is what you’re after, make sure you go on a night when they’re offering the $59 option.,Once you sit down at the sushi bar, you’re not given a menu or any idea of what’s about to come. You just get a quick hello from the clearly super-busy chef, and then your meal begins. You’ll start with a salad, and then get 12 pieces of fish - all of which are served with a bit of wasabi and a wash of soy on top of a small pile of rice. The order of fish you’ll get here seems to jump around and isn’t served from light to heavy. A piece of seabream may be followed by some fatty tuna, which is followed again by a mackerel or golden eye snapper. Whatever piece of fish is placed in front of you, though, is guaranteed to be fresh and delicious. A couple of handrolls and a bowl of miso soup cap off your 15 courses, and you’re usually out in about an hour flat.,As good as the fish is, the operation has some obvious flaws, and you’ll certainly see them on any busy night. When the chef doesn’t get the shrimp he’s been waiting for from the kitchen, he’ll disappear for a few minutes into the back, or yell across the restaurant into the kitchen something like “Faster!” or “Where are the goddamn shrimp?!” if they still haven’t arrived. You might wait a little longer than you’d like for a refill on your water, or have to get up to find some extra paper napkins. And the fact that the omakase can change any given night, both in price and number of courses, is certainly not ideal. But as a whole, Da-Wa is only showing you all the hard work that usually goes into preparing an omakase without any gentle spa music or black marble chopsticks to dress it up. And that’s what makes it the kind of place you’ll want to book for a Wednesday night - especially when watching the slideshow of your last omakase becomes too much to handle.,",/philadelphia/reviews/dawa-sushi-and-ramen,0.7977563325529361,521
"Whether you’re in Philly, Los Angeles, or a random fishing town off the coast of Alaska, picking up pizza at most slice shops works the same way. You walk up to the counter, place an order, hand over some cash, wait, get your pizza, leave the store, then eat. It’s simple, easy, and you know exactly what to expect.,That’s how Circles + Squares works, too - but what they hand over the counter just happens to be the best pizza in Philadelphia.,Circles + Squares is a small, nondescript pizza place on a residential Kensington block that looks like your average slice shop, with a long counter, a water cooler, and a few tables on the sidewalk outside. However, there are a few key differences that make their pies much more than just sauce, cheese, and dough in a cardboard box. It’s the ingredients they use, like a block of pecorino romano that’s freshly grated onto every pizza that comes out of the oven. And it’s the tins of hand-kneaded dough that are prepped for days before being put in the oven, ready to be made-to-order as each guest comes through the door. It’s also about the guy himself, who started selling his pizzas via Instagram back in 2016 and now finally has his own space. Still, though, he’s behind the counter personally baking every pizza and shouting names in a comical sing-song voice as they come up. Sometimes he’ll even take one look at something that comes out of the oven and decide it’s not good enough to sell and offer to make you another.,Ordering here is simple - the biggest decision you have to make is whether you want a thin-crust circle or a thicker, Detroit-style square (they only sell whole pies, no slices). You can get either option with red sauce and toppings or have them just covered in cheese and drizzled in garlicky olive oil. Everything is excellent, but what this place does best is their squares. They’re soft and fluffy on the inside, almost like a Sicilian slice, but the outside crust is crispy and charred with burnt cheese. It makes for the perfect texture contrast, with the thin layer of charred crust keeping the chewy, soft insides tucked in safely. And even if you can’t finish the whole pie in one sitting, that’s ok - it’s the only pizza that somehow stays just as crispy and fluffy when you reheat it days later.,You should know that, even if you come right after they open, it usually takes 30 to 45 minutes for your order to be ready. If you show up past 7pm, it can take up to an hour to get your pizza - or they might just be sold out. But even when you wait over a half-hour for your pies to come out of the oven, it’s worth it. These pizzas are works of art, and like a Picasso, Monet, or an elaborate notebook doodle drawn during a boring meeting, they take time.,There are a lot of really great pizza places in Philly, but there’s something about Circles + Squares that makes it better than all the rest. Maybe it’s the simplicity of one guy at the top of his game, like Iverson in 2001 or LeBron on the Heat, baking 80 or so excellent pies a night that makes you want to show this place to everyone you know, and maybe even a few people you don’t know. It’s not dressed up or overcomplicated. It’s just your average, run-of-the-mill takeout pizza place with a few barstools, a water cooler, and the best pies in the city.",/philadelphia/reviews/circles-squares,0.7968613870766739,1230
"Han Dynasty has a bunch of locations these days, but the Old City original is still the best one. It’s in an old, ornate building that has a long bar where you can sit and watch whatever sports games happen to be on. It also has our favorite Sichuan food in the city, and you can order a whole lot of it for about $25. People really love Han Dynasty - and we kind of don’t blame them. Their dan dan noodles are our favorite thing here (even though they’re pretty spicy), but if you can’t handle the heat, there are about 50 other things on the menu that you can get instead. Actually though, you should really just get the dan dan and suck it up. It’s worth it.",/philadelphia/reviews/han-dynasty-old-city,0.7293637397623703,1352
"If you’re the kind of person who likes to stay in the know about restaurants, you’ve seen Royal Boucherie get a lot of press since it opened in 2017 - and it’s almost all good press. That’s likely because it’s from the people behind some of Philly’s best spots, like Royal Izakaya &amp; Sushi, Laurel, and ITV. It’s likely not, however, because the food or service is especially exceptional.,It’s not that Royal Boucherie is bad, per se. In fact, there are some things we really like about it. It’s in Old City, and the main dining room feels like a pub where every cop character that Mark Wahlberg’s ever played would meet for a brooding reunion. If you come any time after 6pm, it will be dark, lively, and perfect for a first date. Sit at the bar, order a few glasses of wine and some charcuterie, and you’ll have a fun time.,The problem for us is the food. Some of it is pretty good, and if you know how to order, you can have a perfectly pleasant experience here. Much of the menu, however, is wholly unmemorable or, as one of our New York friends who thinks she’s better than us put it, “fine.” The menu is French-leaning, and includes raw bar staples like oysters and cured scallops. This is by far our favorite section of the menu, and you’ll be happy with pretty much anything you order from it. The small plates are also fine, if not totally exciting, but if you find yourself here on a date, you should share the escargot. And if the date is going well and you decide to stay for a full meal, the lobster garganelli is also worth your time.,There are a few dishes, however, that are more problematic, like the roast lamb. It’s one of the more expensive things on the menu ($32), and for all that money you essentially get a few bland pieces of lamb, topped with a slice of lamb belly that’s really just a grilled chunk of fat. Eating this will make you fantasize about the 99-cent pizza shop down the street, and how many pizzas you could buy with the money you spent on the lamb (approximately four full pizzas.) ,Royal Boucherie is somewhere you should go for a glass of wine and a few snacks before your actual dinner. It shouldn’t be your main event. Unless, of course, you’re trying to expedite the date and skip right to the nightcap, in which case we suggest you have some oysters and leave us out of it.",/philadelphia/reviews/royal-boucherie,0.8753383352756073,930
"Urban Farmer is modeled off of a classic Chicago steakhouse, meaning all of the steaks are categorized first by cut and second by where the cow lived it’s (hopefully very long and pleasant) life. It’s probably the most modern-feeling steakhouse in the city, and it’s much brighter and airier than the classic chandeliered bank vault you usually eat your steaks in. You can’t really mess up an order here, but the best decision you can make is to get the steak tasting, where you’ll get three different six-ounce samples for $70.",/philadelphia/reviews/urban-farmer,0.8550380449845891,672
"Front Street is universally loved. This is not an exaggeration. We asked our moms, our boss, our sister who’s still in college, that one guy we always see at the dog park, and our friend who self-identifies as an LinkedIn influencer. It’s one of the most versatile spots in Fishtown, serving food from breakfast until late night, with a cafe area in the front that’s perfect for grabbing a latte or smoothie. They’ve got a comfortable backyard, complete with a second bar for when the crowds start to take over inside, and they take reservations for all times of day, essential for when you’re trying to avoid that hour-wait on weekend mornings.",/philadelphia/reviews/front-street-cafe,0.8569955040022872,1151
"Sports bars are a mood - and not a mood you’re always in. Some days you don’t want to deal with sticky surfaces, people arguing from across the room, and greasy plates of hot wings. That’s why it’s good to have a place like Olly - somewhere you can get a decent, even healthy meal and watch sports when you’d rather not fight with a stranger over whether or not the Sixers should fire their coach.,Olly is more useful than your average sports bar, too. It’s a great spot to watch the game, but you should also go for a sidewalk brunch during the summer, a casual weeknight dinner, and a beer at the bar with a visiting Patriots fan who’d get verbally assaulted anywhere else in the city. Don’t expect a rowdy crowd here at any point in the day - it’s never super loud or full, and even people who are just here for the TVs are behaving like they’re at their in-laws’ house for the first time. The inside is also bright and spacious, which is practically the opposite of how we’d describe most sports bars.,The food here is classic American bar food, but a little better and healthier than the reheated mozzarella sticks at your neighborhood dive bar. Olly’s wings are dry-rubbed in spices and served with an herbed yogurt instead of a paper cup of bleu cheese, the bacon cheeseburger is topped with a cornichon aioli, and the apple pie comes with a scoop of ginger ice cream instead of vanilla. ,And unlike your average bar, where the only vegetarian option is a side of celery and carrots sticks, Olly’s vegetable-based dishes make up around half the menu. There’s a Moroccan-spiced whole honeynut squash that’s both sweet and a little spicy from a harissa sauce and buffalo cauliflower that’s a solid alternative to hot wings. There’s also a full kids menu with things like mac and cheese and ants on a log, which means you can bring your 4-year-old here too.,Maybe the biggest upgrade from your average Philly dive bar is Olly’s drink list. They have natural wines on draft, a long list of beers and ciders from around the world, and seasonal cocktails that range from a rose martini to a mezcal toddy. Instead of cheap tall boys stacked across the bar, you’ll see small groups of people sharing pitchers of Japanese pale ales and drinking Gruners by the carafe. It’s essentially like if the dive bar that served you $1 Huge Ass Beers in college graduated, got a job, and became a respectable member of society.,Olly isn’t the most exciting place in the city to watch a game or have a meal, though. Some of the fancy bar food falls a little flat, like a mushroom tart that doesn’t have much flavor and a walnut-covered ball of cheese served with a few crackers that feels like an afterthought. And you won’t get the electric, “bleed green” energy you might get from a dark cave called McFadden’s or O’Neill’s. But a place with good, somewhat healthy food that’s always showing the game is a welcome change from a classic dive.",/philadelphia/reviews/olly,0.8578383162317269,682
"If you’ve ever taken a walk around Penn’s campus, you’ve probably noticed that there are tons of food trucks parked near the quad - especially on days that it’s nice out. Honest Tom’s used to be one of those trucks, until the lines got too long and they moved into a colorful little cottage that looks like something Snow White would sing to animals in. All of their food is vegan, and the tacos are both delicious and pretty cheap (you can get two for $7). Plus, you can be in and out in 10 minutes flat, so it’s exactly what you need after a long day of work or a particularly humiliating group workout.",/philadelphia/reviews/honest-toms-taco-shop,0.855276848916327,814
"Doing the basics of your job is expected. Like if you’re a babysitter, you make sure the kids don’t fall down the stairs, and if you’re a motivational speaker, you say cliche things into a microphone. But being great at what you do takes a lot more than just the bare minimum, which is where White Dog Cafe comes up short. It does all of the easy things well, but anytime it tries to get creative with the menu, the results are a letdown.,White Dog Cafe is located inside a little brownstone next to Penn's campus that's full of fake taxidermied dog heads on the walls and has one of those menus that doesn’t quite fit in a box. You’ll see everything from pasta to arepas to pho, which makes it an easy choice for students to bring their parents when they want to prove to them that they’re actually respectable adults. The versatile menu also means that, whether you’re here for a weeknight dinner or a weekend brunch, White Dog is usually busy.,The problem is that even though the menu has lots of things that look creative and interesting, they all ultimately fall very flat. Like the seared yellowfin tuna, which is served in a bowl with vermicelli noodles, bok choy, some pickled chili peppers, and then, as if they mixed up their recipes, braised beef brisket. A server pours an herb pho broth over the whole thing and even though the presentation is impressive, it’s actually a very bland and criminally overpriced ($33) bowl of pho. The broth is basically warm brown water, the seared tuna is well-cooked but completely flavorless, and the brisket, which is the only thing that has any sort of distinguishable flavor, is somehow dry even when it’s soaked in the broth.,If this was the only sad dish on the menu, we might just call it an anomaly and move on, but there are a lot of other things that end up being flavorless or otherwise off. The arepas are so dry that you’ll have to flag the waiter down for a refill of water every few bites. And the Kennett Square Mushroom Soup, which has been on their menu for years, has the consistency of a watery smoothie and tastes pretty much just like truffle oil, with no other seasoning.,There are still reasons you might end up at White Dog, like at the request of a family friend who’s helping you do your taxes or when you need a place near Penn to meet someone for a quick drink and some roasted garlic hummus. And it is possible to eat a decent (if a bit overpriced) meal here if you stick to the dishes that are hard to screw up, like the pulled pork mac &amp; cheese or the butternut squash ravioli. It’s just not a place you need to go out of your way to try.",/philadelphia/reviews/white-dog-cafe,0.8919262795572735,913
"The battle for who has the best cheesesteak will probably never end, but Tony Luke’s is always in the conversation. This South Philly counter has been around for a while, and they have a bunch of locations now, but the one on Oregon is the original. It’s also the best one, despite having the same menu as all of the other locations.

"Tre Scalini is a small Italian BYOB on East Passyunk that’s often overshadowed by the more popular places right around it, but it’s worth coming here for a date night or just a casual weeknight dinner with a few friends. It's especially true during the summer, when they set up a bunch of tables on the sidewalk out front. They go super fast on nice nights but, if you call ahead, you can sometimes get them to hold one for you. If not, it’s still usually not too bad of a wait, and you only have a few months to take advantage of eating outside anyways - so just suck it up and stare down the guy who’s nursing the last few sips of his glass of pinot grigio until he finally abandons his post.",/philadelphia/reviews/tre-scalini,0.8925248938613826,71
"Pat’s vs. Geno’s: the original Philly rivalry. Two places, serving essentially identical cheesesteaks, on the same street corner. Pat’s was the original, but then Geno’s opened and it was the newer, flashier spot. People took sides. ,That rivalry has since become stale and boring, just like their cheesesteaks. But Palizzi Social Club versus Messina Social Club is a duel for a new generation - two members-only clubs that are located just a couple blocks away from each other in South Philly. Palizzi, the OG, and Messina, the newcomer that has a guy from Top Chef running the kitchen. However, unlike the Pat’s and Geno’s rivalry, Messina offers a completely different experience from Palizzi. Its excellent food and cocktails, plus modern Godfather feel, prove that there’s room for both of them in the city.,Messina’s small, 30-or-so-seat space off East Passyunk is never super crowded. You could show up on a random Friday with a date, walk past the neon “Don’t Be A Dick” sign on display near the front door, and get bar seats right away. While you’re there, order one of their great cocktails, like the “Strut And Burn,” which has tequila, blackberry brandy, elderflower, and lemon. If you decide to stay for dinner, they reserve half the dining room for walk-ins (otherwise you can get a table by calling ahead). ,Unlike at Palizzi Social Club, the food at Messina isn’t just Italian dishes. The menu spans from small plates like honey-glazed wings and tender Spanish octopus with smoked eggplant, to handmade pasta and a whole lamb shank that’s marinated in a sweet honey glaze and is so tender it could be eaten with a spoon. The best dish on the menu, though, is the pierogies. They’re filled with a mashed potato mix that rivals anything we’ve ever had on Thanksgiving, covered in a light but flavorful sour cream sauce. There’s also the option to get them topped with pulled lamb, and we’ll just say that if you don’t, you should probably have your membership revoked.,Another thing we like about Messina is that becoming a member is relatively easy. All you need to do is call, ask for one, and then go pick it up. You won’t have to pull up with an old beach chair and hang out in front of the restaurant for six hours in the hope that they’re handing out a few memberships like you would to get one for Palizzi.,Maybe we didn’t need another members-only club in Philadelphia. But we got Messina, and we’re happy it’s here. Because at its heart, it’s just a really good restaurant with a solid bar and a few dishes that we can’t stop thinking about. Both Pats and Geno’s could take a few plays out of their book.",/philadelphia/reviews/messina-social-club,0.8521747880145707,864

"There’s a reason we always watch shows like The Office and 30 Rock right before bed. They’re comfortable, familiar, and we can basically quote every line. We have a similar reason for why we come to Kanella Grill so often. The menu at this spot in Washington Square West has exactly what you’d expect from a Greek place - piled-high salads, gyros, and lots of kebabs. But despite its simplicity, we always find ourselves craving the food here.,Whether you walk in for lunch or dinner, the menu at Kanella is always the same - save for the dips of the day or a grilled fish special. Even though the options are always the same, we’re happy knowing that the $14 lamb platter is just as good and filling as the last time we had it. And that we can get baskets full of the same fluffy pita we know and love for an early lunch or late dinner. Sure, we could buy all the stuff to make a gyro at home, but it’ll never be as good as the one here that comes with crispy fries and tzatziki.,Although you’ll never leave Kanella disappointed with your meal, it’s not a place that’s worth going out of your way for. But if you’re looking to get a dinner for under $25, or for somewhere you can always grab a last-minute reservation for a casual date - you can always rely on Kanella.

It’s a little different than the one you’re probably used to with cheese whiz and boiled meat, but in a very good way.

"If you asked us where to eat on North Broad, there are a handful of places we’d recommend over Gabi. We’d tell you to grab some pasta at Osteria, listen to live music over shrimp gumbo at SOUTH, or get all-day breakfast at Cafe Lift. If you do find yourself at Gabi, though, you can have a perfectly decent time. As long as you order the burger.,Theirs is topped with melty, gruyere-like reblochon cheese, thick, bite-sized bacon pieces, and finely chopped caramelized onions that remind us of a sweet salsa (in a good way). Then there’s some lettuce and a seasoned tomato, all sandwiched between a perfectly toasted bun. Add an egg if you’re feeling it, but either way, it’s a genuinely great burger that’s better than the sum of its parts. ,Unfortunately, the burger is the only impressive thing about this French diner-esque spot. The rest of the menu, which ranges from a sad Nicoise salad to steak frites that take an awkwardly long amount of time to chew through, is average at best. There are escargot that are buttery but otherwise flavorless, a cheesy ravioli with absolutely nothing interesting about it, and a croque monsieur that they might have forgotten to cook altogether.,Similarly, the drink list is a bit all over the place. They have a solid wine list with affordable options - you can get a whole bottle of house red or white wine for $24, or a glass for $7. The cocktails, however, aren’t worth your time at all. Most of them are gin-based, with French liquors like rinquinquin or lillet, and some are overly sugary and shockingly blue, while others are super watered down.,The space and ambiance are both confusing and kind of match the food - they’re essentially flavorless. It looks like a diner inside, with tiled floors, metal-edged tables, and light fixtures that could have been pulled from the set of Grease. But it doesn’t have any of the innate charm that diners are known for. You won’t find ripped leather seats or servers who ask if “youse guys” are all set while holding 47 plates in their left hand. ,So if you were hoping that Gabi would be your next first date spot, the answer is “not if you want to see the person again.” But if you do end up here, maybe because your friend insists on having her birthday dinner at a French diner with blue drinks on the menu, then stick to the plan. Order the burger, get it with an egg on top, and let the table know that you’ll be picking the restaurant next time.",/philadelphia/reviews/gabi,0.8353649301343177,829
"It seems like every day there’s a new, ultra-specific beauty product we’re told we absolutely need. Like a nail bed exfoliator that swears it’ll turn your stubs into dainty claws, or a clay mask especially for the backs of your knees. We miss the days when you could walk into a drug store, head straight to the hygiene aisle, and pick up a combination shampoo-conditioner-body wash: the simple product that takes care of pretty much any soap-related need.,Like a 3-in-1 beauty product, Southwark has a lot of different components - a cocktail bar, a dressy dining room, and a casual back patio. But unlike the shampoo-conditioner-body wash trio - which we concede should probably remain separate products - Southwark nails all three elements, and ties them together with some of the best food in the city.,Southwark is a French-leaning place in Queen Village, and when you first walk in, you won’t be able to see past the large bar. In fact, if you didn’t do any research beforehand, you’d probably think this one room - which serves the full menu - is the entire space. You wouldn’t be disappointed either, because on its own, it’s one of the best cocktail bars in the city - with fruity milk punches and silky smooth highballs, all named after famous movie lines.,But beyond the bar, through a narrow hallway, are two entirely different spaces. There’s a dining room with white tablecloths and fancy silverware that feels a bit proper, and might cause you to start thinking in a British accent. And then out back there’s a plant-filled patio where couples are sharing charcuterie plates, splitting bottles of wine, and slipping pieces of prosciutto to their dogs. ,These three starkly different experiences make Southwark a useful place for a variety of situations. But the food is really what makes Southwark what it is. From the perfectly crispy fried green tomatoes to larger dishes, like the creamy stuffed summer squash, everything is flavorful and shareable. There are pasta dishes that rival the ones from our favorite Italian spots, and they come in both whole and half portions, in case you can’t decide between the buttery pea and ricotta ravioli or the potato gnocchi buried in a savory pork and tomato ragu. Just get half portions of both, and maybe throw in a third bowl of shrimp squid ink fettuccine if you’re really hungry. The menu works for any situation, whether you’re here to catch up with a few friends and split a bunch of half-portions of pasta, or have a full dinner with clients in town from New York who each want their own steak.,Even if the food at Southwark wasn’t top-notch, you’d still want to come here for a cocktail at the bar. But the food is so good you’ll want to have a summer dinner out on the patio, and host all of your future family graduation dinners in their dining room. It’s a place you get excited to go to, no matter what reason you come here for, and no matter how many times you’ve been. If there was a 3-in-1 beauty product that could make us feel half the things Southwark did, we’d clear all the shelves and stockpile it in a storage unit somewhere. Until then, we’ll continue spending our summer nights on Southwark’s back patio, and buying our shampoo and conditioner separately.",/philadelphia/reviews/southwark,0.861388404574883,285

"If a members-only restaurant like Palizzi Social Club existed anywhere other than Philly, it’d be filled with a bunch of rich and powerful people who paid thousands of dollars to be a member. The whole thing would be so obnoxious and elitist that even if the food was great, it would be hard to enjoy.,So thank god it’s in Philly, on a residential block right off East Passyunk, where it costs $20 for a year-long membership. No matter who you are or who you know, you have to wait in line for hours to get a chance at one of their coveted membership cards. There are no celebrities at Palizzi either - it’s filled with locals from the neighborhood that come here with their families for a weekly pasta fix. And most importantly, the Italian food here is f*cking phenomenal.,Palizzi has one very strict rule: they don’t allow reviews. But since we never had a membership in the first place - we have nothing to lose. We did what everyone who doesn’t like waiting does and went as a guest. Every member is allowed three guests per visit, so if you don’t want to check Instagram for new membership releases, we recommend you find someone who did the work for you. ,One of the best parts of having dinner at Palizzi is waiting at the bar for a table. Once you get inside (by ringing a doorbell and checking in with someone), you have to post up at the bar. Within minutes, you’re asking the lady next to you where she got her shirt, and she’s giving you the number of her tailor because you’ve already discussed needing to get a jacket hemmed for a wedding next weekend. It doesn’t hurt that while all this is going on you’re being served strong cocktails - all made with Italian liqueurs, like grappa and fernet, with twists of things like chili salt or ginger cordial.,The food, though, is what will make you want to forge someone else’s membership card. From the classic caesar salad to the spumoni for dessert, everything’s incredible. There are a few specials every night, set by the owner and a family friend who also acts as a server and runs the dining room most nights, but there are a few things that never change. Like the pepperoni stromboli, which is by far the best folded-pizza creation we’ve ever tasted. ,Palizzi might feel exclusive because of how tough it is to get a membership card, but everyone can get one if they try hard enough. It’s a social club without all the pretenses of a social club, where it doesn’t matter who you are or what college your parents paid your way into. What they’re really about is keeping the same people coming back every week to eat some really good food. Food worthy of a review, even if it breaks some rules.,Since Palizzi doesn’t allow reviews, we don’t have any photos of the dishes on our rundown. You’ll just have to use your imagination.",/philadelphia/reviews/palizzi-social-club,0.872790739107129,1257
"We’re always trying to find the best restaurants for every occasion, whether it’s as simple as a second date spot, or something a little more obscure - like where to take your uncle to tell him it was you who broke his VCR 17 years ago. Sometimes though, it’s as simple as wanting to walk in somewhere with a few friends for a reasonably-priced bowl of pasta and maybe a few glasses of wine. It’s spawned a category of restaurants we’re calling “Nice-Looking Places To Eat Pasta With Your Friends On A Tuesday” (NLPTEPWYFOAT), and Cry Baby Pasta is pretty much a perfect example of one. ,Unlike a lot of places that fit in this category - namely restaurants with stark white walls and lots of hanging plants - Cry Baby has a bit more personality. This Queen Village Italian spot looks like your casual neighborhood place became moderately amused by ’80s rock and roll and decided to invest in things like leather jacket-printed wallpaper and a banner with “I’m so tired of being good” printed in black gothic script. Everything on the menu is around $20 or less, which means you won’t face a flurry of angry texts at its suggestion, and it also has a great natural wine list and cocktail menu. ,There’s also just an energy in the room that makes you want to come back here over and over again. Cry Baby has that incredibly hard to find mix of full but not annoyingly crowded, and loud enough that the table next to you can’t hear your entire debate on whether Kendall Jenner should be allowed at Sixers games, but quiet enough that you can hear both sides of the argument and come to a rational conclusion.,While you probably go to a place like Cry Baby more to get caught up on your friends’ current life drama than for the food, you’ll still get a very solid meal here. The entire bruschetta section is great, with toppings like mozzarella and honey or mushroom and smoked ricotta on thick squares of fluffy sourdough toast. And the chicken rigatoni pasta, covered in a slightly spicy vodka sauce and topped with chicken and pancetta, is perfectly al dente and easily the best pasta on the menu. Round your order out with a couple of plates to share - the fritto misto and tortellini en brodo are our favorites - and you’re set.,But like your former roommate’s choice in life partners, not everything you can pick from here is a hit - like a bland bowl of cacio e pepe and branzino that doesn’t need to be topped with clams. Regardless of the occasional miss though, Cry Baby is a place you’ll find yourself regularly recommending when your friends ask if you want to grab dinner. Just make sure to order enough wine so they’re less judgmental when you tell them about the time you jammed a peanut butter sandwich into your uncle’s VCR.",/philadelphia/reviews/cry-baby-pasta,0.8582099188703639,225
"When you finish ordering at Neighborhood Ramen’s counter, you’ll get a laminated picture of a random object. Sometimes it’s a moth, or a dinosaur—other times it’s a toy truck. And while you wait for the city’s best bowl of ramen to arrive to your table, you’ll wonder why so many restaurants still give you numbers when they could be giving you butterflies instead.,Unlike the more upscale Queens Village restaurants surrounding it, Neighborhood Ramen is casual. You’ll want to hang out here—even after you finish the last of your shoyu broth and see a smiley face staring up at you from the bottom of your empty bowl.,If ramen is one of those foods that you only seek out when it’s a cold, rainy day, then you haven’t been to Neighborhood Ramen. Everything, from their sides to soups, is so good that you’ll find yourself confusingly craving it on an 85-degree day in the middle of summer. There are five choices of ramen on the menu, along with one mazesoba, listed from light to heavy, and the broths are more flavorful than any other place you’ll find in Philly. Our favorite is the shoyu made with chicken broth that we’d drink straight from a mug. The only other items on the menu are a few small sides—like vinegary wontons and edamame.,In between bites of food, you’ll notice the restaurant staff acts like they’re members of an indie band rather than people who just happen to work in the same place. And after delivering your order, which usually includes a bowl of oshinko (Japanese pickles) or sesame salad on the house, they’ll probably hang out for a few minutes just to tell you about the shop or ask you if you’ve seen any good shows recently.,Neighborhood Ramen doesn’t take reservations, so plan to get here early—at 7pm, a line starts to wind out the door. It moves quickly, though, so you can get excited knowing that a dinosaur or a shooting star and a seriously good bowl of ramen aren't too far away.,",/philadelphia/reviews/neighborhood-ramen,0.7423555409743695,1352
"Rione is the best place on this list that actually delivers, meaning there’s no waiting in line or trekking across the city to pick up your pizza. Rione’s Roman-style squares by the slice will come to you, whether you’re coming home from a long night out, waking up after a long night out, or just really involved in an 8-hour Friends marathon on your couch. The slices are chewy, soft, and topped with sweet tomato sauce that is just as good with cheese as it is without, and you can try lots of different topping combinations without having to order a bunch of full pies.",/philadelphia/reviews/rione,0.8612272008728228,1161

"Not only is Oregon Diner open 24/7, but it also has a full bar, and is a cool five-minute walk from the stadiums on Broad Street.

"A few years back, Urban Outfitters decided to get into the restaurant game, and they bought, among other places, Amis Trattoria. So it makes sense that they opened an Amis offshoot right by their headquarters in the Navy Yard.

"Street Side is a tiny Vietnamese BYOB on Girard that mostly does takeout, so when you end up working late in the office and are too tired to even reheat the chicken you put in the freezer for this exact occasion, it’s a good place to stop at on your way home. Everything is inspired by Asian street food, and other than their pho (which is one of the better bowls of soup around), this place mostly does small things that are easy to eat on the go. Some of our favorites are the pork belly rice paper roll, the kroeung beef skewer, and the pork and chive dumplings.",/philadelphia/reviews/street-side,0.8182814981412343,1056

Plus, if you end up closing down the bar one night, this place also serves brunch burritos, tater tots, and Bloody Marys for the morning after.",/philadelphia/reviews/american-sardine-bar,0.8747295483278588,1036
"The Continental is somewhere you probably already stop by after work every once in a while to get a martini and some bar snacks with a coworker. But when it’s nice out, you should take the elevator up to the third floor and have that martini at their rooftop bar instead.

"We’ve all been to our fair share of Places With Really Long Menus. They’re spots where the menu is almost the length of a teen lit novel, and they make you want to start taking notes in the margins like it’s a homework assignment. Rangoon is one of these places, but you don’t need to bring a highlighter when you eat here, because pretty much every single one of the more than 100 dishes on the menu is excellent.,Rangoon is a casual Burmese restaurant in Chinatown and it’s a great place to sit around one of their long tables with a big group and order entirely too much food. Everything is served family-style, which makes it easy to share a bunch of dishes in a Thanksgiving-esque coordinated plate pass around the table. And while you could have a perfectly good meal here by simply closing your eyes and pointing to a bunch of random dishes on the seemingly endless menu, the thousand layer bread is the one thing above all else that you need to get.,The first thing you should know about the thousand layer bread is that it’s not, in fact, a thousand layers. So if you’re currently picturing a cake-like structure that stands a couple of feet high with 1,000 paper-thin sheets, you can go ahead and pop that dream bubble now. It’s actually somewhat of a cross between a croissant, roti bread, and the outside of a particularly good grilled cheese sandwich. It’s rip-able, shareable, and comes with your choice of a hearty, soup-like sauce mixed with either curry chicken, vatana bean, or potato for dipping. Any dinner here should start with at least two orders of this, or way more if you’re with a big group.,Other than the thousand layer bread, there are a couple other things you should prioritize, like the jungle chicken, which is mixed with bell peppers, mushrooms, snow peas, and onions, and is covered in a coconut green curry sauce. It’s both savory and citrusy, and if you don’t order this, you’re doing yourself (and everyone at your table) a huge disservice. The tea leaf salad is also a must-order and one of the most interesting things you can eat here. It’s a pile of tea leaves and cabbage, mixed with tomatoes, sesame, peanuts, fried onions, and dried shrimp, and it's light and fresh but at the same time super flavorful. Other than these, you can go back to that whole closing-your-eyes-and-pointing technique for the rest of your meal.,No matter which plates wind up in front of you here, we can almost guarantee that you’ll leave impressed and very full. And that’s exactly what you want from a place like Rangoon, where you can show up unannounced with a big group, share a bunch of food, and spend less than you do per day on the Amazon Deep Web. Unless, of course, you plan on ordering the entire menu. In which case, please document it to show future generations what a true hero looks like.",/philadelphia/reviews/rangoon-burmese-restaurant,0.8654550717663162,1237
"Nick’s is a sports bar that’s just like all the other sports bars in Old City, except for a few small differences. For one, they have a huge fish tank behind the bar. We’re not totally sure how they got that passed by the FDA, but if you find yourself here during a game that you’re not particularly interested in, you can just do what we do and create fake lives and names for all of the fish. They also have way above average bar food - like a signature roast beef sandwich and a burger with bacon cooked into the patty.",/philadelphia/reviews/nicks-bar-and-grill,0.8378584287666628,682
"There was a time in our lives when we would wait in lines—whether it was for an overrated club where we didn’t know anyone inside or the DMV to get a license replaced after dropping the last one down a sewer grate. But then we grew up and realized that clubs are better in theory, and you can replace your license online while you binge watch The Office for the fourth time all the way through. Now, if you find us waiting in a line, it will be almost exclusively at South Philly Barbacoa.,Even before South Philly Barbacoa started receiving national attention, there was almost always a small line out the door. That’s because this place spends days preparing and cooking their barbacoa, and the work shows. The meat is flavorful and juicy, and you’ll quickly find out that no matter what toppings or sauces you do or do not put on them, the tacos are truly phenomenal and without a doubt the best in the city.,Besides the barbacoa, there’s also pancita (chopped pork belly), which is just as good as the lamb in our opinion, and both are served on freshly-made corn tortillas that come from a huge ball of masa sitting on the counter. The consome is also excellent, and even though it’s mostly just broth with some rice and chickpeas mixed in, it’s exactly what you want after a long night out or when the temperature mysteriously drops 30 degrees in December. ,Unless you’re not in charge of your plans or you’re a masochist, we suggest you get here by 11:30am on one of the two days a week they’re open (Saturday and Sunday) to avoid the bulk of the crowds. It may be on the early side for lunch, but we’d rather eat early than spend an hour rearranging our iPhone apps while we wait for a taco.,",/philadelphia/reviews/south-philly-barbacoa,0.884911690173533,880
"Fette Sau is an indoor/outdoor barbecue spot in Fishtown that serves some of the best smoked meat in the city. Since Philly doesn’t really have a regional style, you’re able to get a little bit of everything here, from ribs and brisket to sausages, along with all of the classic sides. The inside feels sort of like one of those rib shacks off the side of the road, with big communal picnic tables and a semi-industrial look, and the outdoor patio has string lights hanging over it, which makes it a good option for a last-minute date, too. Bring a big group and claim a whole table, or grab a seat at the bar for yourself and try a few bourbons - they’ve got over 100 types to choose from.",/philadelphia/reviews/fette-sau,0.8346853170083748,41
"Food-wise, the Loco Pez in University City is basically the same as the one in Fishtown. It has great tacos and cheap beers, and if you happen to come here on one of their dollar-taco nights, you’ll be able to eat, grab a PBR, and leave a tip without having spent more than $10. This location near Penn’s campus, though, feels much less divey than the original one, and is somewhere you wouldn’t feel weird bringing your in-laws to.",/philadelphia/reviews/loco-pez-1,0.8903608133209036,158
"Five-star resorts are overly expensive because they come with things like private beach access and full-body mud masks that claim to make you look 15 years younger in 45 minutes. And Eagles club seats will set you back more than ones closer to the field because they have that heated inside area where you can take shelter during the last few games of the season. But sometimes you don’t need all the extras, and for those situations, there’s Sakana: a toned-down version of a high-end sushi place with an excellent omakase at a fraction of the cost.,Sakana is a casual BYOB in Queen Village with a 12-seat counter and a couple of tables for overflow. There’s a host upfront who manages the seating situation, and two or three sushi chefs using their iPhones to control the whatever-they-feel-like playlist, which might start with a single spa-like flute playing you to sleep and end with a Spotify mix that’s probably called “LSD Vibes That Your Mom Will Still Like.” But despite feeling more like a laid-back test kitchen than an actual restaurant, the sushi here is similar to what you’d expect from a place where you have to know someone to get a reservation and close your eyes while you sign the check.,The only choice you’ll have to make at Sakana is whether to do their signature omakase, which is 12 pieces for $58, the 10-piece sashimi omakase for $58, or the $108 sakana omakase, which comes with 21 pieces and some of the gold-flake, caviar-filled extras you might see at a special occasion spot. But unless you’re super hungry or trying to impress a friend who quotes Jiro Dreams Of Sushi in casual conversation, the signature omakase is the way to go.,The 12 pieces of fish vary from standards like hamachi and mackerel that might come with miso or wasabi, to more unique things like firefly squid with a drop of green pepper salsa and uni with seared foie gras. Throughout the meal, the chef checks in with you to ask what you like and what you’re not a fan of, in case uni reminds you of a wet dish sponge. And while the meal may seem like it’s over after your last piece arrives, you should order an ice cream sandwiches before you leave. They have two on the menu, one with green tea ice cream and another with vanilla and pieces of fruit, and they’re both sandwiched between buns that taste like cake cones. It’s a simple, three-bite dessert that will have you wondering why you don’t carry them around in a refrigerated backpack to eat after every meal.,Unless you opt for the sakana omakase, your spot at the counter only lasts 45 minutes, which means your meal might be bookended by appetizers and dessert at a separate table. It disrupts the flow a bit, and even though they’ll usually make it up to you with an extra piece of sushi if you’re stuck waiting for an especially long time, it can bring the entire experience down a notch. So if it’s a seamless and uninterrupted anniversary dinner you’re looking for, complete with bottle service and heated hand towels between each course, you should probably head down the street to Royal Sushi. But if you just want to meet a friend for a casual dinner that consists of some pre-purchased sake and high-quality fish, there’s no better option than Sakana.,The best option is the always changing 12-piece signature omakase. Here are a few examples of what it might include.",/philadelphia/reviews/sakana-omakase-sushi,0.7899486005159022,521
"There are probably a few specific reasons why you’d leave Philadelphia to go to South Jersey. Maybe your in-laws live in Haddonfield, or you have a house down the Shore in Margate. Or maybe you love beating your friend who insists they have a handicap of 2 at Top Golf. Whatever your reasons, going out to dinner probably isn’t one of them.,That is unless you’re going to Zeppoli - a Sicilian BYOB in Collingswood that’s worth leaving the city for. ,Your first thought might be to ask why - why would you leave Philly for pasta when there’s more great Italian food here than there are real estate ads from former Eagles player Brent Celek? And that’s certainly a valid question. We have everything from old-school, red-sauce places with plates of chicken parm bigger than a small toddler to fancy, tasting menu-only spots where a single piece of gnocchi constitutes an entire course.,But Zeppoli isn’t like every other Italian spot in the city. It lives in its own world over in Collingswood, and while it looks like your typical small, family-owned Italian restaurant with dim lighting and friendly service, it’s not. It feels special - like the kind of place that you’d take someone who you want to spend serious time with and bond over really f*cking good food. You’ll start to realize what makes this place different the moment the lemony, light, seafood-centric dishes begin to arrive. For the tagliatelli al limone topped with bottarga, even though the sole ingredient in the sauce is lemon, and it looks like something you could have made on a single burner in your college dorm room, it’s complex - with more distinct flavors than a master somm could find in an expensive bottle of wine.,There are other surprises on the menu, too - like big balls of spinach and ricotta gnocchi that start melting as soon as your fork touches them and an antipasto board that makes any other charcuterie plate look like a grocery store spread. But possibly our favorite thing here comes after all the excellent mains. It’s the zeppole - big, fluffy donuts covered in a fried, cinnamon-sugar shell sitting on a pile of molten dark chocolate. Regardless of whether or not you’re a dessert person, these should be on your table.,If you want a good plate of pasta, it might not be your first thought to drive over the Ben Franklin Bridge. And on an average Tuesday night, that makes sense. However, if you’re looking for a plate of pasta that might convince you to move across state lines, then you’re going to want to plug Zeppoli’s address into your GPS.",/philadelphia/reviews/zeppoli,0.8684356218587397,642
"Here are some things you can count on when you go to Penang in Chinatown: you won’t have to wait longer than a few minutes for a table, you’ll get to choose from a bunch of Malaysian (and Thai) options on the menu, and you’ll walk out having spent $20 or less on consistently great food.,Penang is open from 11:30am until midnight every single day. That makes it an especially good place to stop into when you’re looking for a good meal at an off-hour, like a 3pm lunch or an 11pm dinner. But no matter when you come in here, the menu is always the same - with pages and pages of delicious and interesting Malaysian and Thai dishes. Some of our favorites are a crispy roti pancake with chicken and potato dipping sauce for only $4, satay skewers for $7.50, and a huge plate of coconutty, lemongrass-y beef rendang that’ll last a week for $15.,Everything you order at Penang is meant to be shared family-style, and your time here is best spent ordering a few big plates of food and passing them around one of their huge round tables. You could probably come alone during lunch and have a great meal as well, but a place like Penang really shines when you show up with a few friends, share some great food, and don’t have to worry about how much you’ve spent.",/philadelphia/reviews/penang-malaysian-cuisine-restaurant,0.8555743069871788,231

"Just like how Nicolas Cage’s career is the summation of every character he’s ever played (both the ones he got Oscar nominations for and whatever he’s been doing for the past decade), we think that the value of a restaurant is equal to the sum of its parts. It’s mostly about the food, but it’s also about how you feel when you’re there, and whether or not you can imagine yourself enjoying a dinner there.,So when it comes to The Love, we have mixed feelings, and here’s why. When you walk in, it feels kind of like you just stepped into a more upscale version of a mall restaurant, and everything is just a little too formulaic - from the white brick arches that are faded in all the right places to the navy awnings with The Love. printed in Futura (the most universally appealing font ever created). At the same time, though, the food at The Love ranges from good to something you’d go actually out of your way for.,The menu includes a mix of Southern food and things that you’d expect at a nicer version of the Cheesecake Factory. And even though we roll our eyes every time we see the “Love Bird” (a buttermilk fried chicken dish that’s so decadent you’ll probably bring half of it home and eat it for your next three lunches), and cringe when we order the “Eat Your Veggies!” (the perfect crudite for when you want to pretend you’re being healthy before you order an entire bowl of pasta), we keep asking for them. The pastas are also great, especially the smoked brisket pappardelle, which is perfectly al dente with a smokey beef brisket ragu and topped with a heap of creamy ricotta cheese. It’s a must order, even if you’ve already gone out for pasta three times this week.,Despite their new paint smell and general menu corniness, we actually kind of like it here. Most of their food is pretty good, and there are a bunch of occasions that would land us here, like a solo dinner outside when we feel like people watching, or a client lunch that they suggested take place at The Capital Grille for the 15th time in a row.,So if you don’t mind the Barnes &amp; Noble cafe vibe inside, or are lucky enough to snag one of their sidewalk tables, The Love is worth your time. Much more worth your time than, say, watching Ghost Rider for the first time since you left the theater at minute 11 in 2007.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-love,0.8463312464109971,938
"If you’ve ever been asked to connect your phone to the bluetooth speaker and DJ at a party, you know that all it takes is one misplaced Celine Dion song to make the whole thing super awkward (and lose any future DJ privileges). We’ve found that the same is true for restaurants. You could be having a totally enjoyable meal, but as soon as you get one or two bad plates, the rest of the meal is tainted. Noord is one of those cases. ,Noord is a Danish BYOB located in a small corner building in East Passyunk that only has about 15 tables, along with a good amount of sidewalk seating, and it’s a nice place to hang out. They have big windows that they open up when it’s warm, and while it’s mostly a dinner spot, Noord also does a Sunday brunch that we like, except for the fact that we always forget it’s BYOB and end up drinking virgin mimosas.,When it comes to food, Noord does a few things really well. The Keshi Yena, a sweet and savory casserole dish that’s filled with ground chicken, gouda, and raisins and topped with grilled pineapple, is one of our favorites on the menu, and it’s one of the more unique dishes you’ll find in the city. The prawns are worth sharing as well, and we think about the sweet, perfectly doughy brambleberry bread pudding at least twice a week before we go to bed. You’ll also definitely want to order the house-made fennel bread as a mop to soak up all of the sauces that a majority of the dishes are swimming in. ,There are some things, however, that aren’t so great. The grilled gravlax, which is topped with pickled beets and some celery sour cream, is a whole lot at once, and the fish is entirely too salty. Overdoing it on the flavors seems to be a problem here in general, because there’s a similar issue with the rabbit leg dish, Konijn in het Zuur. The leg, which is well-cooked and we imagine could be part of a pretty great plate of food, is swimming in a pool of what tastes like straight vinegar. It’s hard to enjoy when you take one bite and your face looks like the guy on the Sour Warheads wrapper.,All that being said, you can definitely still have a solid dinner here if you know what to order. The space is nice and we’d recommend it for a more casual date or to catch up with the sort-of-friend you keep promising to hang out with and finally got roped into actually making it happen. You definitely don’t need to go out of your way to eat here, but if you live around the corner or spent the last few hours shopping at one of the five plant stores down the street, it’s a perfectly fine place to grab some food.",/philadelphia/reviews/noord,0.8565268669534862,756

"After one too many brunches involving overpriced avocado toast and your roommate abusing the bottomless aspect of mimosas, you need to go somewhere this weekend that’s simple and good. Luckily, Fishtown has Sulimay’s. This cash-only diner on Girard feels stuck sometime in the 1970s and serves classic breakfast dishes without a Bloody Mary bar in sight. The chicken and waffles (topped with poached eggs and hollandaise) are worth splitting, regardless of whatever else you get. Just make sure to schedule time for a nap after you eat.",/philadelphia/reviews/sulimays-restaurant,0.8944884076574577,1036
"Everyone has a favorite bagel place in the city, and ours is Philly Style Bagels in Fishtown. It’s a small corner spot off Frankford where there’s nowhere sit and eat, but it’s right next to a park, which is a much better place to eat a bagel anyways. Their bagels aren’t the big fluffy kind you’ll find elsewhere - they’re much more petite and, in our opinion, that makes them more flavorful. They’re also boiled in beer, which we’re assuming is what makes them “Philly style” as opposed to the kind made everywhere else.,Pretty much get anything you get here will be good, but if you’re coming from out of the neighborhood, you should be getting one of their sandwiches instead of just the sesame bagel toasted with butter that you usually get on a Sunday morning. Our favorites are the banh mi and the hummus sandwiches, but truly, they’ll all make you wonder what you were doing before you found this place. They do tend to have a line out the door on weekend mornings, but it goes quickly and is usually gone by noon.",/philadelphia/reviews/philly-style-bagels,0.8845706115566007,258
"There aren’t a ton of places you can go in the city for good Southern food - everything is either an “upscale take” on it, which just ends up meaning they serve fried chicken with caviar on top, or it’s a dive bar that serves you something that they say is gumbo, but is completely unrecognizable. Common Wealth is the perfect middle ground, and somewhere you can go for a consistently good, low country-inspired meal. ,It’s not much to look at - it’s really just a bar in Old City with a tin roof and some tables lined up against the wall - but it’s well priced and the food is exactly what you want from a southern spot, like the fried green tomato pimiento melt on sourdough that’s basically just a way better grilled cheese. It’s a good spot to have a casual lunch during the week if you have some time to kill, and it’s also one of our favorite places to grab brunch on a Sunday. They serve things like apple cider pancakes, and their mimosas are strong enough to make you forget you have to to back into the office the next day.",/philadelphia/reviews/common-wealth,0.8597618740781005,405
"If you’re out at a bar in South Philly, then La Virgen De Las Nieves is where you should stop for a late-night meal. The small Mexican corner store is right down the street from Bok Bar, and at around midnight you’ll see people stumbling through the doors to share one of their huge huaraches that come in a pizza box and only cost $10. You should also know that they’re open all day, and everything on their menu (like their tacos and enchiladas) is delicious.",/philadelphia/reviews/la-virgen-de-las-nieves,0.8613356829377726,880
"Gigi Pizza might be the smallest sit-down restaurant in Philly - it’s essentially the size of a college dorm room or Gwyneth Paltrow’s pantry. But despite being physically tiny, Gigi manages to make a huge impression. They serve the best pizza in Queen Village, and some of the best in the entire city.,When you first walk into Gigi, you’ll likely think there’s a much bigger room around the corner in the back. But what you see is what you get: six tables, twelve chairs. They also don’t take reservations or have a waitlist, which means eating here can be a bit of a logistic nightmare. We’ve waited an hour at a bar across the street only to have our table given up to someone else who happened to walk in the front door right before us. To avoid that happening to you, hang out at Olly (their sister bar next door) and check back every 15 minutes to make sure you get a table. ,If that sounds annoying, we don’t disagree. But the pizza you’re rewarded with is worth the wait. It’s Neapolitan style, with a fluffy, soft crust and thin bottom that’s just strong enough to hold all the toppings. The puttanesca pie with olives and anchovies is just the right amount of salty balanced with the sweet tomato sauce, and the clam and broccoli pie has a bunch of garlic butter on the dough - making the crust almost taste like garlic bread. Even the simple margherita pie is excellent, with a perfect amount of cheese sprinkled like little puddles across the sauce.,The dough makes its way into other dishes on the menu as well. Like the baked St. Alban’s cheese dip that should be called “pizza fondue” and, most importantly, the cannoli dip dessert. It’s essentially pizza crust coated in butter, sugar, and cinnamon, cut into pieces and served with a sweet ricotta and chocolate chip dip. Think Domino’s CinnaStix, but without the need for an “if it sucks we’ll take it back” guarantee. ,The few non-pizza items on the menu, like a meat lasagna with heaps of slightly-sweet whipped ricotta and a burger pulled straight off the menu of neighboring Olly, make great add-ons to any pizza. But you shouldn’t go out of your way for them. And the drink list, like the restaurant, is small but mighty. There’s just a simple board on the wall with a few reasonably-priced options (some wine, beer, and two cocktails) which makes the process of choosing a drink easy. ,Come to Gigi for a weeknight dinner when you have nothing better to do than sit at a bar and wait for some really good pizza. You might score a table immediately, or you might end up waiting for a group of 12 people to finish a three-hour dinner. It’s a gamble, but one that ends in really good pizza 100% of the time.",/philadelphia/reviews/gigi-pizza,0.7791601678292641,736
"We want to tell everybody we know about Soup Kitchen Cafe because this place has excellent and well-priced breakfast and lunch food - our favorites being the $8 shakshuka and a soup and half sandwich for $13. Plus, they have a full bar that’s stocked with local beers, and they make a couple of great house cocktails like the elderflower aperol spritz and a jalapeno margarita. It’s small and comfortable inside, and since it’s not a super popular spot for dinner, it’s easy to get in when you don’t want to wait 40 minutes for a table.",/philadelphia/reviews/soup-kitchen-cafe,0.8458678130087316,311
"Bok Bar is a rooftop bar on top of the Bok Building in South Philly and they have one of the best views in the city. Unfortunately, they’re only open during the summer (late May to late September), but it’s worth planning a day out here. They don’t take reservations and once the weather warms up, there’ll definitely be a line, but this is one of the few times when it’s actually worth the wait. ,They’ve got a nice selection of wine and beer and it’s great for a chill evening of snacking and drinking. The food options are limited to light bites, like fries or falafel wraps, so come before dinner on East Passyunk or for a nightcap after a taco tour in the neighborhood.",/philadelphia/reviews/bok-bar,0.8803089226379142,752
"If you’ve ever experienced the tragedy of getting a few chips into a plate of nachos before learning the toppings have been spread unevenly, we recommend an immediate trip to El Rey in Rittenhouse. The menu is full of Mexican dishes you can’t go wrong with like the short rib enchiladas, chile rellenos, or their impeccably designed nachos—they’re smothered in sauce and gooey cheese and come in a pizza pan. As all nachos should. ,The space is like a festive, retro diner full of booths, long tables, and vintage movie posters plastering the walls—all of which make it a good spot for an after-work team outing or a last-minute birthday dinner. During Happy Hour, they’ve got $2-$4 tacos ranging from vegetable, chicken, and carnitas options, $3 beers, and $5 margaritas. It gets pretty packed once everyone slams their laptops shut, so head there early if you want a seat. As a bonus, they also do lunch during the week and weekend brunch, which is almost never crowded. ,",/philadelphia/reviews/el-rey,0.8403913546912947,75

This place is cash only and doesn’t take reservations, so expect to wait on the weekends.

"When a friend comes into town, it’s natural that you want to impress them. And that’s not going to happen if you take them to the fanciest or newest place in Center City. You need to bring them to a place with really good drinks and even better food that’s in a neighborhood where there’s a lot more going on than just a few cool restaurants. If you really want to impress your friend, go to Fishtown and eat at Wm. Mulherin’s Sons. ,Wm. Mulherin’s is an Italian restaurant that doubles as a boutique hotel, but not in the traditional sense with a restaurant in the lobby and a full-service hotel surrounding it. Instead, it’s really just a restaurant that happens to have some well-decorated rooms upstairs. The entire place feels like it was picked up by a tornado in the Catskills and put down in perfect condition on the corner of Front and Master. There are murals on the walls of animals camping in tents, brown leather booths in every corner, and a large wood-paneled bar in the front of the restaurant that’s usually filled with people grabbing drinks on first dates. In the main dining room, there’s a fireplace that looks like it should always have an old guy smoking a pipe in a red velvet robe sitting in front of it. All of these details show how Wm. Mulherin’s epitomizes the spirit of Fishtown - it’s a place that’s trendy without being obnoxious.,It’s not only how the restaurant looks inside that makes it feel so cool and, at the same time, so uniquely Fishtown though. The place feels high-end without being stuffy, and comfortable without being filled with people in sweatpants. That’s mainly due to the service. The servers always explain the menu and the wine list in a charming, relatable way that gets you excited to try whatever skin-contact wine or pizza they recommend. And if you had to wait a few extra minutes for your table, you might get some extra bites on the house. ,All other details aside, the excellent Italian food gives Wm. Mulherin’s most of its Feel Good Factor. The menu, which ranges from small plates like a citrusy hamachi crudo to larger, shareable plates like Neapolitan-style pizzas and pastas, is crowd-pleasing but not basic. All of their pastas are incredible, the creamy porcini cavatelli and the rich duck agnolotti are our favorites, and they offer half portions so it’s easy to try a couple of different ones. They also have some of our favorite pizzas in Philadelphia - the margherita is always our go-to, but there are also other great options like The Spicy Jawn with pepperoni and long hot peppers. You could have an excellent dinner if you just stick to small plates and a bunch of pastas or pizzas, but if you want to order one of the mains, the half brick chicken is one of our favorite things here. ,Every once in a while, you might have a meal at Wm. Mulherin’s that’s disappointing. You might get a cacio e pepe that’s essentially butter noodles with hardly any “pepe,” or a speck and egg pizza that almost tastes like it’s been reheated. But even on a bad night, your dinner will still be impressive. Nine out of ten times you bring someone here, it’s a meal that neither of you will forget - it might even convince a few of your visitors to make the trip to Philly more often.",/philadelphia/reviews/wm-mulherins-sons,0.8181372157502236,258
"A small bowl of guacamole at Condesa costs $15. The guacamole is great, the bowl is pretty, and it comes with a few big, round tortilla chips that are crispy and just salty enough. But still, it’s a $15 dollop of guacamole. It’s the only real complaint we have about Condesa, and now that it’s off our conscience, we can talk about why we love this Mexican place in Logan Square.,The restaurant somehow manages to feel cool even though it’s directly connected to the lobby of the Pod Hotel. It has vaulted ceilings with funky chandeliers, and everything is a shade of sand, save for a few colorful pillows scattered on the benches. It’s impressive, which should come as no surprise since it’s from the people behind Suraya, a Lebanese spot in Fishtown that we would live in if we could. And although it’s a little more expensive than it should be, this is some of the most delicious Mexican food that you’ll find in the entire city.,Every tortilla, every tlayuda, and even their chocolate cake is made with imported, stone-ground Mexican corn - which they mill themselves in-house every day. It makes all the difference when you take a bite of a carnitas taco and the blue corn shells are soft and flavorful, yet still sturdy. Or when you break into the fluke tostada and realize the saltiness of the hard tortilla chip underneath is the perfect complement to the sweet, grilled pineapple on top. Not every dish relies on the masa to be great though. The goat birria stew, which consists of tender pieces of goat in its own consomme, is so good you won’t even want to put it on a tortilla or mix it with any of the salsas on the table.,In addition to Condesa’s main dining room, they also operate the hotel’s rooftop bar, which looks like it was airlifted from Miami, and a cafe on the ground floor with great pastries and breakfast tacos. They’re three parts of the same restaurant, and they work together seamlessly to make Condesa a go-to for pretty much any occasion. They feel like an added bonus on top of an already great spot.,Like staying at a 5-star resort, when you come to Condesa you’re going to spend some money - most small plates and tacos are around $15 and entrees range from the $24 goat birria to a $42 large-format grilled meat dish. Chalk it up to the hand-milled masa or the fancy, Center City location. But the incredible experience is worth the price tag. The only thing not worth your money is the $15 guacamole, but you didn’t need us to tell you that.",/philadelphia/reviews/condesa,0.7956317246344011,798
"It would be a mistake to call the basement izakaya at Double Knot a secret, just like it would be to assume that your friends will be impressed when you take Lincoln Drive instead of I-76. But even though most people already know about the sushi dungeon downstairs, it still feels like a secret when you’re eating here—a secret that happens to include some seriously good food.,Double Knot is a Japanese spot in Midtown Village, and it’s really two restaurants in one. There’s an all-day cafe on the main floor that you could watch on a time-lapse and never catch a moment when it’s not busy. While it’s usually packed with people eating rice and noodle bowls and working on laptops, at 5pm the lights go down and it turns into more of a bar scene, but with a slightly different menu than what you’ll find at the izakaya below. And that’s really where you want to be,Downstairs at Double Knot is a different world—one that you might not know existed if you just walked in off the street looking for a cup of coffee or the free Xfinity wifi signal. Guarded by a host who will make sure you have a reservation before sending you down the dark back staircase, the dining room is flooded each night with people who are all celebrating something—whether it’s a 30th birthday or finally succeeding in making a perfect playlist for your ride to the Shore. But if you’re here on a date or with someone you want to sit next to and have an uninterrupted two-hour conversation with, the long sushi bar up front is the perfect place to enjoy an excellent tasting menu that’s worth being the main attraction of your night. ,While you can also order a la carte, the $65, 10-dish tasting menu will get you the best variety from the huge menu. As soon as you put your order in, it’s like the lights dim and the staff begins a synchronized ballet of dishes that makes you feel like you’re the only person in the room. The minute you finish your two thin pieces of raw salmon topped with soy ginger and spicy ponzu, that plate is whisked away and replaced with a bowl of two perfectly chewy edamame dumplings in a light sake broth. ,There are so many standouts during a meal here that you’ll find yourself spilling the not-so-secret to anyone who will listen. Like the shrimp tempura taco topped with chili and radish slaw that we’d climb a moderately steep hill for, or the slew of robatayaki skewers, each better than the one that came before. But those two things are just a small part of Double Knot’s extensive menu—their full offering ranges from sushi to larger plates like Tokyo hot chicken and nori crusted filet , and every dish is so good that you’ll want to order two tasting menus just for yourself next time.,As much as you may want it to be, the basement at Double Knot is far from confidential. The food is just too good to have stayed in the group text, which means that reservations here–especially on the weekends– aren’t easy to come by. And although you probably won’t be able to walk in on a Saturday night and grab a table last minute, getting a reservation here gives you the kind of rush you normally only get when your friend says, “I need to tell you something but you have to promise you won’t tell anyone.” Except at Double Knot, you won’t be able to keep that promise, but that’s kind of the point.,",/philadelphia/reviews/double-knot,0.8395293746279323,642

But if you’re three hours deep into a Law And Order: SVU binge on Hulu and just can’t find the energy to remove yourself from the couch, they’ll also deliver a margherita with the perfect cheese-to-sauce ratio right to your door.

"Have you ever liked something so much that it’s hard to explain exactly why you feel so passionately about it? Maybe it’s a hair salon you’ve been going to for years, your favorite book, or a Tweet that you favorited back in 2010. Whatever it is, you want to immerse yourself in it as much as possible.,That’s how we feel about Pizzeria Beddia, the reincarnation of a small, counter-only pizza shop in Fishtown. At the old spot, you’d have to wait up to six hours just to get a plain pie to eat on a stoop somewhere. But this new version is practically the opposite—with a u-shaped bar and dining room, a well-curated natural wine list, and a kitchen that can spin out hundreds of pizzas every hour. Those are just the tangibles, though. What we really love about this place is the way it makes us feel—and while that’s hard to explain, we’re going to try.,“Where am I?” is something you’ll ask yourself every single time you step through the front door at Pizzeria Beddia. Because the first thing you feel when you walk into Beddia is that you’re far from home. It looks like no other restaurant in Philadelphia. The space has high ceilings with light-wood planks, but is otherwise mostly white, with only a large, smiling cloud lamp hanging over the bar to greet you. And everyone here looks like they just finished being extras on an independent film, or came from a Julien Baker concert up the street. ,Before you even think about eating, your first move should be to run through the wine list. There’s a great selection of bottles, as well as a few options on draft at all times—which also makes this pizza place one of the best natural wine bars in the city. And there aren’t too many of those (yet, at least), so order a glass or five while you’re here. ,There’s probably a part of you that wonders if this pizza is worth the two-month wait for a reservation, or two hours if you walk in. And, sure, maybe it won’t live up to the Mount Everest of pedestals you put it on. But it’s f*cking delicious pizza, so who cares, really? The first time you ever take a bite of the plain cheese pie, no toppings—your immediate reaction is one of nostalgia. There’s something about it that tastes like a memory. For one person it’s the boardwalk pizza from their favorite place down the Shore, for someone else, it’s a better version of the stuff from Chuck E. Cheese. The thin, crispy crust is strong enough that your pizza can hold all the little pools of grease safely in place until they make it into your mouth. There’s nothing about this pie that’s revolutionary, but eating it makes you feel like every perfect slice shop from your past has come back to throw you a surprise party.,You’ll want to dedicate a majority of your stomach’s real estate to the pies, but there are some other items on the menu that are worth getting for the table. Our favorites are a caesar salad topped with hot, roasted vegetables, judion beans soaked in lemon and olive oil, and squares of thick, spongey tomato pie covered in sweet tomato sauce and dripping with olive oil. But the main thing you’ll want to save room for is the soft serve. Both flavors, espresso and sweet cream, are excellent—with or without the amaro topping. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and don’t want to wait two hours for a table, the ice cream is the only thing you can order from the restaurant to go. Even if everything else disappeared, the single hostess stand handing out two flavors of soft serve would be the best ice cream shop in Fishtown.,“Is it weird if I come back tomorrow?” is the last thing you’ll think as you’re walking out the front door. Maybe next time you’ll sit outside. Or maybe you’ll end up at one of the big, spacious booths in the back room. Or maybe you’ll just grab a seat at the bar and try to make friends with some of the people who actually look good wearing wide-brimmed hats. Either way, you’ll be back. Because it’s really not just pizza—it’s an experience that you’ll want to repeat over and over again.,",/philadelphia/reviews/pizzeria-beddia,0.8014571814135949,736

For main entrees that are all $20, we didn’t expect to get vinyl record-sized plates like their spinach-tossed saag chicken that gets its maple taste from the fenugreek it’s cooked in or tender lamb in buttery cream sauce.

With an even smaller menu than the main hub (they only sell Honduran baleadas and Salvadoran pupusas, sides, and churros here), the warm grab-and-go pouches full of melty cheese, black beans with diced jalapeños, or pork keep us coming back. And even better, with street and lot parking near the market, we don’t have to struggle to find a spot near Rittenhouse Square.",/philadelphia/reviews/el-merkury,0.8902059581047727,871
"Philly is known for many things, but great fish tacos aren’t one of them. However, this Kensington spot—which has a massive outdoor patio and rows of overhead lighting—serves some that we can’t get enough of. The breaded fluke is perfectly cooked and each bite into the taco drizzled with chipotle mayo makes us forget about a week of “I hope this email finds you well” messages. And even though finding Sor Ynez might be as hard as finding your car in PHL economy parking (it’s tucked in a massive lot next to a warehouse), the vegetarian and vegan-friendly menu is perfect for a Happy Hour or full dinner when you also want to sip on cocktails made with Mexican gin and corn-infused tequila.",/philadelphia/reviews/sor-ynez-kensington,0.8798112280848055,900
"We thought we’d stumbled into Best Buy when we walked into The Fin and saw the 25-foot widescreen TV above the bar. But the Fishtown spot is not just a place that has a screen fit for an NBA 2K player’s dream—the dining space has all the makings of a high-end steakhouse, including a raw bar. ,When you’re here, either for a full dinner or just to watch a game, make sure to get an order of the shrimp and grits. It’s a shareable starter that we’d come here to eat solo just so we didn’t have to divvy it up, and what we like most about it is the creaminess from the mix of parmesan, gouda, and cheddar. But when we’re feeling friendly enough to invite a group for some late-night (they close at 2am) surf and turf charcuterie or a shrimp boil, there are plenty of cocktails made from house-pressed juices and bottles of wine to pair with it all.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-fin,0.8835833930280002,905
"This Northern Liberties spot is two concepts in one: a pizzeria that serves up fresh to-go pies and hoagies and a 250-seat restaurant where we spend our time sipping on Italian soda cocktails during Happy Hour. While we’re always on the lookout for a good sub, you should come here specifically to sit in their dining room and have a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine with a few friends. ,They also have a good amount of seating in their outdoor covered garden and TVs for nights where you want to watch both the Germantown Ave. crowd and the one at Wells Fargo Center. The menu ranges from grilled octopus and chicken parmesan to a $92, 32-ounce porterhouse steak, but you’re better off keeping it simple with their spaghetti alla chitarra. It has plenty of parmesan creaminess, trumpet, cremini, and button mushrooms, and a hint of white wine flavor in each bite.",/philadelphia/reviews/figo,0.8896805411622701,326
"Girard Avenue’s Primary Plant Based is climbing up our list of our favorite vegan places in the city (watch your back, Vedge). They have comforting dishes like masa ball soup that’s filled with golf ball-sized heaps of corn dough, sweet pumpkin cornbread, and kohlrabi hand pies. Their jackfruit carnitas medianoche is so spot on with its sweet and tanginess blend—it’s like a cheesesteak and french toast had a baby—that it had us searching for the perfect smiling gif to send to our group chat when describing it. There are plenty of large tables in here for you to bring a small group of friends, but we also love it because it’s perfect for a cozy solo meal.",/philadelphia/reviews/primary-plant-based,0.875609700697822,1049
"Some things we’ll never forget: waking up early in the morning to clean the house on Saturdays as children, the Phillies 2008 championship, and the first bite of the birria tacos and ramen from Juana Tamale. ,With mounds of queso, stewed beef, and green onions swimming throughout the consomme, the ramen is both gooey and soupy all at the same time. And the queso birria taco that comes with each order has corn tortillas that are flavorful from being grilled in skimmed fat and crispy enough to sop up the broth without losing any of their texture. ,They’re only open on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday and have a small dining space, but their salads, tacos, vegan wings, and churros are so good that we’d eat them next to the bike rack at the East Passyunk Gateway if we had to.",/philadelphia/reviews/juana-tamale,0.7996937892353002,798
"When a new pizza place opens up in Philly, it gets swarmed faster than a PS5 restock link. Master Street’s Eeva is actually worth that level of attention. The dining room has front row seats to the wood-burning ovens and the otherwise subtle space lets us know that the food, specifically the wood-fired pizza, is the star of the show. Red pies like their margherita have a sauce with a slight sweetness to it, and when we want a crunchier crust, we go for a white pizza like their option with spinach. Its blend of mozzarella, grana, and basil cream gets balanced out by the mellow spice from the chili and garlic. The next time you’re looking for a casual meal of small plates, natural wine, and pizza that’s both tasty and smells like a campfire, head to Eeva.",/philadelphia/reviews/eeva,0.8024730318541298,1025
"The last time we stopped by Hook &amp; Master on 2nd Street, it was filled with Union superfans, a few stragglers from the after-work crowd, and a couple talking about why they retired in Philly–we guess they never heard of the PPA. But we’re not surprised about how busy it is, as they have a few dishes that make us feel as good as those times when the conductor skips our SEPTA Key on the regional rail. ,From their grilled octopus with a perfect char, to their Chicago-style pizzas that have as many topping options as there are ways to fit jawn into a sentence, this place is great for those days where we want something better than a fast slice with our friends. ,We’ll often just head over for a round of drinks, as they have everything from multiple rum flights to their specialty tiki drinks like the Tiger Shark. It’s their version of a whiskey sour that gets a little sweetness boost from the coconut milk.",/philadelphia/reviews/hook-master,0.8979394052967453,657
"This Frankford Ave. spot is where you should come to catch up with some friends over some sushi and small plates from the very long menu. We always order their salmon rice crisp that’s layered with spicy salmon tartare and habanero pickles, and the mix works so well that we take shorter bites just to make it last longer. Another dish that we would consider writing a song about is their curry short rib bao which sandwiches nugget-sized chunks of beef covered in a cumin-heavy sauce.",/philadelphia/reviews/izakaya-by-yanaga,0.8902383506495013,1209
"Putting your phone on Do Not Disturb before going to sleep is one of the best things you can do over the weekend. Another is having brunch at this stunning converted Victorian greenhouse. If you’re looking for something sweet to enjoy while admiring the fountain sculpture in the middle of the dining room, this Germantown Ave bakery and cafe has everything from breakfast biscuits to lemon custard tarts. But an 8oz brunch burger is really the way to go after trying to convince yourself to hop out of bed all morning. 
It’s the right amount of sloppy with a mix of the melted cheese and caramelized onions that might be the second-best combo (next to some shades and a few Tylenol) that a morning can ask for.",/philadelphia/reviews/cake,0.8488414973091049,1315
"Sometimes brunch is really just an excuse to start drinking before noon. And when that’s the case, we like going to The Wayward for their massive gin list and a few French 75s. This Center City French brasserie and raw bar opts to serve this signature cocktail by the glass or in a long carafe, and regardless of which format you go with, the Sweet Dee is one of our favorites. The perfect blend of gin, mint, champagne, and grapefruit is a refreshing mix that goes great with their $3 oysters from 10am-2pm.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-wayward,0.8756482119099454,548
"With black and white marble floors, a towering bar, and every plant imaginable living inside, this French-inspired cocktail bar in University City is a great place to take someone you’re so comfortable with that you don’t go full eyeball emoji face when they ask for the keys to your car. Although the french dip here is fantastic, we suggest choosing something less sauce-focused on a date, like the pan-roasted salmon. The herby boost from the chive vinaigrette might be the secret MVP of this whole place. Well, that or the 90s hip-hop and R&amp;B playlist.",/philadelphia/reviews/louie-louie,0.8772872333157055,1001
"Just like how many generations will never know the pain of a scratched CD, or blowing in an old game cartridge, people passing through 17th and Locust will never know what it’s like to not have a go-to Irish pub. And if walking into this bar makes you feel at home, it’s because it used to be a three-level townhouse. It’s a great place for a laid-back pint, a round of darts, and sharing a few orders of their crispy fish and chips.",/philadelphia/reviews/black-sheep-pub-restaurant,0.8660436778974389,642
"Offering both indoor and outdoor dining, and more sake options than the game piece count on the municipal building courtyard, the menu at this Japanese spot really gets creative with things like a grilled avocado stuffed with salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. But they also do more straightforward dishes well too, like the spicy and crunchy yellowtail with jalapeno mango roll, plus the tempura shrimp rolls. With lunch deals running through 5pm, we can see ourselves dropping in here between conference calls or sneaking out of work a little early for a drink and a few snacks.",/philadelphia/reviews/zama,0.8498143078999894,444
"While a bunch of billionaires compete to see who can travel furthest into space, we can enjoy staying on Earth - where tacos and burritos are acceptable for every meal of the day. And there’s no better place to grab one, after sweating it out at the yoga studio across the street or catching a show at Helium Comedy Club, than this quick-order taqueria. Open daily until 9pm, their roasted duck tacos served on a scallion pancake are our favorite thing here. Topped with a homemade plum barbecue sauce, their juiciness and surprising kick from the ginger slaw is all we’ll be thinking about between warrior poses.",/philadelphia/reviews/revolution-taco,0.8884682208059166,983
"There are a lot of different ways to satisfy a sweet tooth. Some of us just grab an order of cinnamon sugar soft pretzels and others want Gritty to throw a sheet cake at our faces. But if you’re near 17th and Walnut and don’t have the patience to get vanilla frosting out of your favorite t-shirt, we’ve got a detergent-free option for you.

"There are more red sauce joints along the Jersey Shore than the beach has sand. Finding the right one sometimes feels like an impossible task, but look no further because Anjelica’s Restaurant isn’t just the best at the Shore, it might be the best along the entire Eastern Seaboard. ,Reservations may seem impossible at this downtown Sea Bright BYO that sits directly across the street from the beach - but believe us, it’s worth checking time and time again to secure one. When you do, settle in for an incredible and attentive service experience and an enormous meal that offers a perfect mix of land, sea, and mountains of pasta. The tuna carpaccio is the perfect way to ease into a wide selection of appetizers. House-made pastas such as orecchiette in a spicy vodka sauce, caramelle in lemon cream, and mafaldine al ragu are formidable opponents for recognizable options offered just a few nautical miles north within the five boroughs. ,The entrees, such as the veal saltimbocca, are an equally important part of the meal - even if you already feel like you’ve hit capacity. And, yes, you’ll have to find a way to leave some space for one of their seemingly endless options for homemade desserts and pastries, including variations of Italian favorites - like cannoli with a shell made from anise pizzelle, filled with light cream and coated in pistachios. Don’t worry, you’ll be ready to eat again a week later. And if there are no reservations available while you’re in town, check out the Italian street food offered throughout the day in the outdoor paninoteca located in the adjoining alleyway.",/philadelphia/reviews/anjelicas-restaurant-sea-bright,0.8790176741904057,1085
"At some point during the Shore season, you’ll get in that groove where you’ve slept late enough that you’re not sure if you want breakfast or lunch before you hit the beach. When it’s 11am and you have to eat something, Cardinal Provisions is your place. We really like their poached chicken salad piled high on a croissant, their gravlax with beet-horseradish cream cheese on an everything bagel, and their terrific salads (the New Mexico Bowl and Lunch Bowl are standouts). But they also have a wide and creative assortment of vegan options including most of their daily pastries, so this is an ideal place for anyone with dietary restrictions or when you’re particularly looking for something healthy (I like finding ways of putting  “pastry” and “healthy” in the same sentence). But if you just want to go nuts on some cacio e pepe eggs or pork belly hash, Cardinal's got you covered there too.",/philadelphia/reviews/cardinal-provisions-asbury-park,0.8913723897250962,1151
"Serving both Ethiopian and Dominican food under one roof isn't a trend we imagine taking the Shore by storm anytime soon. Rather, it’s the story of one unique restaurant whose chef/owner is from Ethiopia but took it upon herself to learn to cook exceptional Dominican food to appeal to locals at their former location in Long Branch. Then when Ada’s Gojjo opened in Asbury Park, she brought the two styles of cooking together and the result is a unique menu blending Dominican classics like tostones, mofongo, pastelón, and yucca cakes with Ethiopian standouts featuring beef, chicken, and lamb stews served with lentils and veggies on housemade injera. Throw in their takes on the classic Cubano and cheesesteak served with fries or maduros, and Ada’s literally has something for everyone.",/philadelphia/reviews/adas-gojjo-asbury-park,0.8564537663578138,1240
"Fact: there is nothing more summery than sipping cocktails on the porch. And at The Ebbitt Room, located inside the Virginia Hotel in the heart of the Cape May historic district, you can do just that. Featuring Victorian-era-like decor (think every Vampire Diaries flashback) with antique chandeliers throughout and live classical piano playing, this place is truly an out-of-this-time experience. Try the miso-glazed halibut, along with whatever cocktail makes you feel the most like you’re on vacation.

However, Exit Zero Filling Station didn’t need any help in the imagination department - it’s literally a converted gas station that’s been transformed into one of the most frequented places in Cape May. Open daily, you can get everything here from a lobster, shrimp, and crab pot pie to a wide selection of curries and their sweet-and-spicy pad thai.

Served out of soft-serve ice cream machines, this is not the same as the frozen ice cube of sugar water you’ve become familiar with at the grocery store.

Definitely make sure you’re grabbing ample fresh-baked pretzel knots with their homemade beer cheese too. You know, to balance all that sweet with a little savory. As for the croissants, they only make them on Thursdays and you can bet on them selling out.",/philadelphia/reviews/e-holland-sundries-bradley-beach,0.8065322420273231,498
"El Rey might be new to Asbury Park, but it hands down serves the area’s best Mexican food. Located on a residential street a few blocks north of the popular Cookman Avenue row of restaurants and bars, El Rey was recently opened by a local family originally from Oaxaca. The restaurant is BYO (although their cucumber aqua fresca is good enough to make you skip the cerveza) and has become popular for takeout and delivery. Upon entry, you’ll be drawn to the oversized pot of birria bubbling on the stove, but everything here - from choriqueso to carnitas to the quesadilla de maiz - is fantastic. Also worthy of your attention is their pollo rostizado, which sells out quickly each day. Outdoor dining is also too.",/philadelphia/reviews/el-rey-asbury-park,0.8708984865777384,173
"Often overlooked in the discussions around New Jersey diner and pizza culture is the important place that cased meats - particularly hot dogs - hold in our hearts. Most people have their favorite spots and the Shore is no exception. Max’s Bar &amp; Grill, the most recent version of Max’s Famous Hot Dogs (which is slowly inching itself towards its centennial anniversary), is the runaway best of the bunch. The Bar &amp; Grill in Long Branch pairs a wide variety of local beers with their custom blend of beef and pork foot-long frankfurters. Whether you’re looking for a classic with kraut, a statewide favorite Italian hot dog (topped with peppers, onions, and potatoes), or something exotic like a pork roll-topped Jersey Shore dog or a lobster topped surf n’ turf, you won’t go home hungry. If someone in your group isn’t into dogs, Max’s offers a full menu of burgers, sandwiches, fried fish platters, and salads too.",/philadelphia/reviews/maxs-bar-grill-long-branch,0.8380674527486575,589
"Sushi has become a staple for shoregoers with options lining beach boulevards up and down the coast. And of all the choices, Yumi in Sea Bright is the absolute best. Aside from the incredibly fresh nigiri with options like live scallop, amberjack, king salmon, and sea urchin, Yumi specializes in inventive and near-perfect small plates of raw fish - like the octopus carpaccio and fluke szechuan, both of which are light and packed with complex flavors. While they offer takeout options, we recommend Yumi for dine-in to eat this fish as soon as it hits your table. Plus, the Sea Bright location is BYO so you can bring your favorite sake along too.",/philadelphia/reviews/yumi-sea-bright,0.8554625838312744,1072
"The Navesink River and the towns that surround it, namely Rumson, are among the most beautiful anywhere in the state. Located just inland from the beaches of Sea Bright, the only necessary enhancement to the scenic views of the rolling green hill-surrounded river is a fat 10 oz Barnacle Bill’s burger, cooked to perfection at their bar. During Covid-19, Barnacle Bill’s opened an elaborate and frankly beautiful riverfront outdoor dining set-up along the on-premise marina. While the seating may have changed, their classic tavern menu of burgers, wings, and seafood hasn’t. You don’t have to be on the ocean to enjoy the Shore and Barnacle Bill’s offers the area’s best non-ocean views.",/philadelphia/reviews/barnacle-bills-rumson,0.8751451870209344,135
"So you decided you were going to try to outsmart the shore traffic and take the ferry from Manhattan to the beach. Well played. What you didn’t bank on was roasting in the sun on the boat for 40 minutes to find yourself reaching the shores of Jersey in a translucent sweat-drenched shirt. The good news is the Seastreak landed in the Highlands and you’re a few minutes from an ice cream therapy session at Nicholas Creamery. Nicholas is a name that for years was synonymous with fine dining in New Jersey. They’ve taken that same local ingredient sourcing and approach to ice cream making with flavors like chocolate caramel pretzel, honey lavender, and brown sugar cookie dough, and pairing them with made-to-order waffle cones or as the centerpiece in their fantastic milkshakes.",/philadelphia/reviews/nicholas-creamery-atlantic-highlands,0.8773803358189727,141
"While this popular Roxborough spot has plenty of momos to choose from (chicken, beef, vegetable, potato), the steamed bread bun called the tingmo is our favorite thing to get here. They’re fluffy as clouds and work great for soaking up sauces (try the momo sauce if you like your food spicy). It’s not often you visit a place just for the bread but you should make an exception for this airy, perfectly-layered, and spongy bun.",/philadelphia/reviews/white-yak,0.8596677499002416,63
"The aromatic and crispy beef potstickers at Ninja Bao give you the best of both worlds - tender sides and a crunch bottom.

"Speaking of see-through dumplings, the steamed fan kor at China Gourmet might have you questioning if you somehow picked up x-ray vision. The plump and juicy dumplings at this popular Mayfair spot come in orders of three and are filled with scallions, bamboo shoots, ground pork, and shitake mushrooms. The tasty and juicy filling gives the dumpling not only a crunchy texture but a spicy one as well.",/philadelphia/reviews/china-gourmet,0.7839021349382376,233
"Things aren’t simple at Wokano - there are more dumpling choices than coupons attached to a CVS receipt. Even though you’ll want to try them all, the seafood crystal dumpling is the one you should order. With a paper-thin skin that clings to the filling like your t-shirt does after you get stuck in the rain, you’ll see the color of the crab, shrimp, and vegetables peeking through the skin. These soft and chewy bite dumplings are both savory and sweet, and you get a blend of mild onion-y spice in each bite.",/philadelphia/reviews/wokano-chinese-cuisine,0.8273966314250374,1040
"Head up to Northeast Philly for an order of dumplings that will leave you questioning if your eyes are bigger than your stomach. The massive khinkali at Georgian Bread are packed with a soupy and spiced beef, pork, and herb filling.

"Only offering takeout from Monday-Saturday, this corner storefront shop serves up tasty Afghan dishes like their Ashak dumplings.

"Unit Su Vege is a Chinese restaurant that serves exclusively vegetarian and vegan dishes. One of our favorites on their menu is the “shrimp” dumplings, which has a similar taste to that of imitation crab.

"Greek food, especially the stuff from Malelani Cafe, is always one of our go-tos. One bite into any of their pita sandwiches or flaky baklava at and you’ll see why. The chicken shawarma features tangy grilled chicken, spicy roasted eggplant, and housemade tahini, all on a soft warm pita. This massive, packed wrap is about as large as Joel Embiid’s shoe, but we have complete faith you can tackle it.",/philadelphia/reviews/malelani-cafe,0.8042401415586804,416
"Mt. Airy Taproom serves up hearty meals like the brisket sandwich, fried chicken sandwich, and steak frites along with a bunch of rotating options of local and house craft beers. And while choosing just one thing on their menu may be more difficult than using FaceID with those wild LED face masks, we’ve got one standout dish for you: the crab cake sandwich.

"The flatbreads at Earth Bread + Brewery will have you constantly mouthing “oh what did they order?” when someone’s meal passes by your table. You can’t go wrong with the wild mushroom flatbread that’s topped with a blend of four kinds of cheese (mozzarella, Grana Padano, Asiago, and goat). It might seem like five types of mushrooms and four kinds of cheese on a pizza would be overwhelming, but each slice is balanced and tasty.",/philadelphia/reviews/earth-bread-brewery,0.8706940683862321,1161
"To remix the words of Philly legend Allen Iverson, “We’re talking pasta.” Specifically the amazing ravioli from Trattoria Moma, which is stuffed with wild mushrooms and swimming in a light cream sauce that has some sweet but subtle garlic flavor going on. The only way A.I. will forgive us for changing his famous quote (after he somehow reads this) is if he goes to taste all of the amazing Italian dishes coming out of Trattoria Moma’s kitchen.",/philadelphia/reviews/trattoria-moma,0.8788347453469173,12
"Jansen is one of those fine-dining spots that never leaves you with second thoughts when paying your bill. This renovated 18th-century cottage has historic charm spreading from its cozy interior to the backyard garden. It also has a massive heated tent set up for outdoor seating.

"Can you ever have enough pizza places to order from? They’re essential, and like a 1-up mushroom in Super Mario, can end up being a lifesaver. Maker Artisan Pizza is one of the spots you should add to your list. One of our favorite pizzas here is the Philly cheesesteak pie, with each slice having mounds of ribeye, peppers, and sauteed onions. It’s a bold move to deconstruct maybe the only thing more sacred in the city than the Philly Special, but unlike a lot of other pizza spots in town, they really pull it off.",/philadelphia/reviews/maker-artisan-pizza,0.8719441875502743,736
"Years ago, the idea of a vegan soul food restaurant might’ve been as unthinkable as clear roads on I-95. But since Nile Cafe opened and started serving stew fish made with wheat and soy proteins, it’s clear today is a new day.

"Zion’s Cuisine is one of our go-to spots in the city for Jamaican food. The oxtails here are extremely tender and smothered in a tangy gravy, and each platter is made to order and has the perfect amount of spice.

"This Black-owned neighborhood cafe and pastry shop, which is open for takeout and delivery Tuesday through Saturday, is known for their sandwiches. While a good sandwich may be the quickest way to put a smile on our face, the all-day breakfast, specifically the French toast, is the main attraction.

"When going on a hike at Wissahickon Valley Park, knowing about a healthy option nearby is always a plus. At All The Way Live, there’s plenty of fresh, raw, and tasty vegan dishes and juices.

"When Queer Eye came to Philly for its fifth season, one of the highlights for us was that we got a great Mexican restaurant in Alma Del Mar. Months later, the colorful patio furniture is out and the white table umbrellas have opened. You can find some memorable seafood dishes at this newcomer including the greens and seafood salad, the salmon burger, and fish and grits. One of the best dishes, though, is the lobster benedict.

"When you bite into a wing at Love &amp; Honey Fried Chicken, you’ll hear a loud crackle that’s more gratifying than running to the top of the Art Museum steps and hitting the Rocky pose. You can add any of their house-made dipping sauces to your wing order, and we like the hot honey.

"You won’t be forced to take your wings from Curran’s Irish Inn home - the Northeast pub has a large outdoor patio if you’d like to eat them outside.

"For over 40 years, Byrne’s Tavern has been a go-to place for bar food in Port Richmond. They only serve one style of wings here: classic Buffalo.

"This restaurant right by the stadium has as many wing possibilities as there are Instagram filters on Thanksgiving. Our favorite, the lemon pepper wings, are juicy and seasoned with a dry rub that’s just spicy enough that you won’t need to grab your drink with every bite.

"The true test of a great wing is: Does it make you want another and do you want to tell people about it? Fibbers, the 69th street sports bar and grill, is one of the first places we tell people about when they ask us for wing recommendations. Try their house variety when you’re there. The amount of sauce on them is intense but that just leaves room to sop up the tangy spice with your fries.",/philadelphia/reviews/fibbers-sports-bar-and-grille,0.855828024679444,1318

"Le Mandingue is a tiny West African spot near Upper Darby that we learned about from multiple people sliding in our DMs telling us we had to try it. So we went, and we ordered a lot of attiéké, cassava leaf, and spiced, marinated meats. After our meal, we felt equal parts like we might never eat again and also like we might be back in two hours for more egusi soup.

"Pop-up Anchor Light, which operates out of the Stock Rittenhouse kitchen, does lobster rolls really well for a place that isn’t in Maine or Cape Cod. They’re $19 each, but if you’re really craving a solid takeout lobster roll, this is your spot. They do three styles - Connecticut, Maine, and New England - and if you want more than one they also have a four-pack with two lobster rolls of your choice, a shrimp roll, and a crab roll. Add a watermelon salad to really pretend you’re on a yacht off Martha’s Vineyard, and not stuck in a 600-square-foot apartment with a roommate who doesn’t use headphones for their Zoom calls.",/philadelphia/reviews/anchor-light,0.6655625300081993,254
"Here’s your order from Side Of The Road Jerk Chicken, a Black-owned spot in East Falls: jerk chicken leg quarters, salmon sliders, and coconut rice. All three are excellent, and the meats come with your choice of multiple different types of sauce. They range from fruity ones like mango and blackberry BBQ to a classic jerk sauce, and you probably want to get a couple of extras to keep around the house for the next time you make dinner.

"After eating at a bunch of cool Philly spots, you might notice that a lot of them have something in common: they love to pander. You’ll find the word “jawn” more times on these trendy restaurants’ menus than the word “entree,” and it’s almost a requirement that they make some kind of cheesesteak, roast pork sandwich, or incorporate long hots into a dish. ,But Kensington BBQ spot Zig Zag somehow manages to be effortlessly cool and inherently Philly without any of these usual gimmicks. And they also happen to make some incredible smoked meat sandwiches and sides.,There are a few standouts from Zig Zag’s menu of BBQ options. The first is the brisket sandwich - or sammish, as they call it - that’s covered in queso and is so tender it falls apart in your mouth. It’s ridiculously messy, but it’s the best thing they serve. The “TurkEY TEaseR” (yes, that’s actually how they spell it) is the other sandwich that we’ve been writing about in our diary as if it’s our third-grade crush. It’s got juicy, smoky turkey breast, tangy slaw, pickles, and just enough chili oil to give it a kick. Add on a couple of sides, like the esquites or the Sichuan cucumber salad, and this is an excellent meal that’s quickly become our favorite new takeout option of the summer.",/philadelphia/reviews/zig-zag-bbq,0.8867587668636743,812
"Casa Mexico is a small Italian Market spot from the people behind South Philly Barbacoa. They do both lunch and dinner daily (except for Wednesdays), and the short menu changes every single day. For lunch, they do big plates of meat with rice and beans, and every meal comes with a bowl of consommé, salad, and dessert for just $13. It’s one of the best lunch deals you’ll find in the city. Dinner is a bit more expensive, with appetizers like ceviche for $13 and rotating entrees that range from chicken enchiladas to pescado veracruz - but they top out at around $18. It’s walk-in only, and cash-only, so make sure you hit an ATM on the way.",/philadelphia/reviews/casa-mexico,0.8571854284027378,161
"You probably already know about Tired Hands - a brewery based out of Ardmore - because of their popular frothy milkshake IPAs, or because you’ve been to their seasonal beer garden in Fishtown. Right across the street from Tired Hands Biergarten is St. Oners, their tiny new bar and restaurant with a full menu of Chinese food ranging from small plates like salt and pepper wings to big bowls of rice and noodle dishes. But the best thing you can eat here is the beef neck and broccoli - the meat is so tender it’s practically falling apart. St. Oners also has a bunch of the Tired Hands beers on tap (you can buy four-packs of their cans to go too), as well as a few really great cocktails - like one with aquavit, sparkling rosé, and lemongrass.",/philadelphia/reviews/st-oners,0.8575034782436567,557
"The slow-roasted porchetta sandwich from Porcos is one of the best things you can eat in Philadelphia right now. We realize that’s a big statement, but we believe it as much as we know that the world is round, or that Ryan Gosling is too attractive to actually be from Canada. The pork is tender and salty, and comes served on crispy, house-made ciabatta. The menu at the small Washington Avenue bakery is mostly variations on the porchetta sandwich, with standouts like a Cubano with pickled vegetables and the “Spicy Porker” with a long hot relish. The space also has a big case of baked goods which are all solid (especially the chocolate chip cookie sandwich), but you’re here for the meat.",/philadelphia/reviews/porcos,0.8510100628608801,650
"Bread Top House is essentially like a tiny corner cafeteria, with things like lunch sandwiches, pastries, and loaves of bread lined up in containers against the wall.

And definitely don’t miss out on the pineapple sponge cake or the coffee swirl cake.",/philadelphia/reviews/bread-top-house,0.8695120057585248,1237
"TT Skewer is tiny (so you likely won’t be eating in), it’s cash-only, and the only two things on the menu are hotpot and skewers. Your general game plan should be to walk in, order a few skewers of things like lamb and chicken gizzards, and then take them to go, eating them like savory popsicles while you walk around the city.

"You won’t find much French food in Chinatown, but this French-Asian bakery is an exception. A La Mousse specializes in really nice-looking cakes and pastries as well as coffee and tea drinks. A couple of our favorites are the triple chocolate mousse and the Hokkaido cheesecake, but pretty much any mousse- or custard-filled dessert you get here will be excellent.

"Ocean Harbor and Ocean City are hard to tell apart: they’re both dim sum places, they both use carts, and they both have more seafood options than other Chinese places in the city. The biggest reason to come to Ocean City, though, is for the congee - which has salty, savory pork and a century egg (a salty preserved egg). The service is usually better and quicker at Ocean City as well, but otherwise, the two spots are essentially interchangeable.",/philadelphia/reviews/ocean-city-seafood-restaurant,0.8187556017976486,210
"Ocean Harbor is one of the best and most convenient places to have dim sum spots in Chinatown. It’s open from 10:30am to 10:30pm every day of the week, which means you can eat wonton soup and fried seafood rolls for brunch, lunch, or dinner. It can get crowded, but it’s super-efficient.

"The best thing at Xi'an Sizzling Woks is actually their hamburger. There are three on the menu, all on warm, almost pita-like bread, and the most expensive one is only $4.50. Our favorite is the beef and green pepper burger spiced with chilies and cumin - but they’re all great.

"As far as hot pot goes, Chubby Cattle is the best in Philly. The broths are flavorful (get the tomato oxtail) and all the meat, seafood, and vegetable add-ins come in huge quantities. You order with a server for the main stuff, but there’s also a little conveyor belt that zips around the tables filled with bowls of extras in case you decide you’d like to add a handful of enoki mushrooms to your soup. This place can get incredibly busy (and doesn’t take reservations), so you should expect a long wait.

"Nan Zhou specializes in hand-pulled noodles, and that’s exactly what you should be ordering here. The spicy beef soup is the best - it comes in a salty broth, topped with cilantro, radish, and pickled greens. If you want something else besides noodles, you should also try the scallion pancakes or coconut chicken dumplings. It can get crowded, but the service is super fast.

"If the line for a table at David's Mai Lai Wah is longer than you’re willing to wait (which is probably about 10 minutes if you’re coming from the bars), take yourself and all of your friends to Shiao Lan Kung. Like David’s, it’s open until 3am on weekends and has a long menu full of food that will soak up everything you drank earlier. But the service tends to be quicker here, and while the scene isn’t quite as fun, the crab meat lo mein and shredded-pork rice noodles more than make up for it.",/philadelphia/reviews/shiao-lan-kung,0.8714246603002944,1337

Once you and your friends have finished passing around a bunch of huge plates, head upstairs to Bar Saigon.

"Royal Tavern looks like your average corner pub got a little bit of a facelift. The brick exterior is painted bright blue, and you won’t find any ripped barstools or sticky tables by the narrow bar area. The menu also has things you’d find at a regular bar, like a burger and nachos, listed right next to dishes that you wouldn’t normally consider “bar food.” There's fire-roasted mussel stew, butter chicken in a tomato-coconut curry, and a delicious lemongrass yuba banh mi.",/philadelphia/reviews/royal-tavern,0.8825910990063403,682

In addition to pouring more than 70 mezcals and tequilas, they also make their own low-proof tejuino (a beverage made from fermented masa) and tepache (a beverage made from pineapple peels). The food is good as well, with mostly small bar snacks like tacos, elote, and multiple types of guacamole.

"El Techo is 11 floors up from Condesa, one of our favorite new restaurants in 2019, and it’s run by the same people. The rooftop bar looks like it was airlifted in from Miami, with tropical plants, bright tiles, and lounge furniture everywhere. It also has a retractable roof, which means it even feels kind of like Miami, if you can ignore the bleak gray winterscape happening outside. Since Condesa does all the drinks and food at El Techo, you can expect to see a lot of agave-based cocktails and tacos with homemade masa tortillas. It also means that everything’s delicious, which isn’t something you can say about most Philly rooftop bars.",/philadelphia/reviews/el-techo,0.87589710212959,68
"Before it was The Pearl Tavern, this Midtown Village space was just called Irish Pub, and it was Your Average Neighborhood Dive Bar for decades. But when it closed earlier in 2019, the people behind Townsend and Oloroso bought and reopened it without doing much work inside. The biggest difference is what they’re serving - they’ve got lots of craft beer, plus a small but diverse selection of wine and a few cocktails. In terms of food, you’ll see a mix of classic bar food like burgers and wings, along with a large seafood selection, including a raw bar.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-pearl-tavern,0.8509282770303166,92
"Blind Barber already exists in a bunch of other cities, but this is its first location in Philly. The Center City spot is a barbershop during the day, but turns into a speakeasy at night, with bars on two floors that serve cocktails and snacks like grilled cheese. It might sound kitschy, but it’s also really fun - especially on a night when you want to go out out. It’s a club without the sticky floors and strobe lights, and as much as you want to hate it, you’ll probably find yourself here late-night often.",/philadelphia/reviews/blind-barber-center-city,0.8916540567009643,123
"This South Street spot may look like a dive bar and serve all the classic dive bar food (nachos, burgers, etc.), but the biggest reason to hang out here is for the large selection of great natural wine. If you come here any day after work, you’ll find the loungey, retro space full of people drinking growlers of whatever is on-tap and enjoying all of their daily specials - like $10 for a beer, shot, and a burger on Wednesdays. On your way out, stop by the small wine store up front that’s stocked with most of the bottles they carry behind the bar.",/philadelphia/reviews/wine-dive,0.851604532746284,361
"The best part about Good Dog Bar is that all 3 floors of the Rittenhouse spot are covered in photos of dogs. Their own dogs, customers’ dogs, dogs they’ve helped rescue through their adoption spotlight program. There are other reasons to come here too - like the strong drinks and the above-average bar food that ranges from things like hoisin chicken drums to the half-pound Good Dog burger, which is stuffed with Roquefort cheese.",/philadelphia/reviews/good-dog-bar-restaurant,0.8304986821589952,589
"Pho is always good - we’d eat it on a street corner in the middle of summer while wrapped in a heated blanket. And Pho Cyclo, a Vietnamese spot in South Philly, is a great place to get a solid bowl of it. You can get a huge serving of soup for around $11, and the service is so fast that you could be in and out in under 20 minutes.",/philadelphia/reviews/pho-cyclo-cafe-south-philly,0.7720018906568661,913
"The prequel to Hello Vietnam was a place called Nam Son Bakery - a South Philly spot with maybe the best banh mi sandwich in the city. When that closed in 2019, the owners opened Hello Vietnam in Northern Liberties with the same incredible banh mis on bread that’s baked in-house. But they now also have a full dinner service. The BYOB has a short but excellent menu that ranges from appetizers like grilled beef wrapped in grape leaves, broken rice plates, and huge bowls of pho for around $12. You could definitely come here for a weeknight date, but it would still work for your weekly “book club” meet up that’s really just an excuse to talk about the latest episode of Temptation Island.",/philadelphia/reviews/hello-vietnam,0.8815432054237149,913
"For places like Via Locusta, the excitement of going there begins with securing a reservation–you’ll probably need to make one weeks in advance. This Center City spot is where you can get mounds of pasta, warm focaccia, charred octopus, and a grilled swordfish steak while being surrounded by long mirrors, white subway tiling, and round marble tables. And since they have covered outdoor seating, you can also have a glass of wine while watching the action on Locust street and enjoying one of our favorites: the bucatini. The sauce is made with piave cheese and leek so it’s light, creamy, sweet, and has a strong oniony taste to it. They also have a Happy Hour from 4-6pm that features a lineup of $8 spritzes that come in orange, elderflower, and amrao-infused flavors, along with small plates like eggplant fritto for $6.",/philadelphia/reviews/via-locusta,0.850611363305485,804
"Encima is a mezcal bar above Franklin Mortgage and Investment Co., and it has over 70 different types of mezcal that are served in small jicara bowls instead of shot glasses. Most of the cocktails are mezcal based as well, but you’ll also find beer, wine, and two low-proof drinks - tejuino made from masa and tepache made from pineapple peels. You’ll probably spend most of your time in this small, dark space drinking, but they also have some Mexican street food on the menu - with things like tacos, elote, and guacamole with fried pork rinds.",/philadelphia/reviews/encima,0.8549488374040604,1244
"If you’ve ever tried to eat dinner near The Met before a show, then you know your options are pretty limited. But Cicala, an Italian restaurant at the recently renovated Divine Lorraine Hotel, is a new pre-show option to add to your list. In the dining room, a bunch of crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling and occasionally flicker - we’re pretty sure this place is haunted. The menu here is broken down into antipasti, pastas, and large entrees for the table to share. If you’re with a big group, definitely start by splitting the affettato misto, which comes with a big salumi plate and assorted vegetable salads. But no matter who you’re here with, you’ll want to get a couple of pastas - especially the fazzoletti with lamb shoulder ragu and the maccheroni al ferro.",/philadelphia/reviews/cicala,0.864355947851754,287
"Merkaz is from the same people as Dizengoff and Goldie, and it also does Israeli street food. But instead of focusing on hummus or falafel, Merkaz serves breakfast every morning, with things like shakshuka and za’atar toast, and then moves on to pita sandwiches and Israeli sodas for lunch. They don’t really do dinner, but they stay open until 7pm, and you can get a whole roast cauliflower or chicken to take home. Because it’s in the middle of all the office buildings, lines get very long at lunchtime. Come around 2pm for a late lunch, though, and you’ll be able to get a crispy eggplant sabich or Jerusalem grill with chicken hearts in warm, fluffy pita in just a few minutes.",/philadelphia/reviews/merkaz,0.8736891909469913,804
"The Hadley, located on the bottom floor of an old apartment building right off 676, looks like Don Draper’s office but smells like a retirement home. The menu has things like steak, potatoes, and “flatbreads” that we’re not convinced aren’t frozen pizzas. Aside from a drink at the bar or a Happy Hour snack, there’s really no reason for you to come here.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-hadley,0.8613226529267565,164
"When you first sit down at River Twice, you’ll notice that there’s no silverware on the tables - and it’s because every table has built-in utensil drawers. Everything at this East Passyunk BYOB is that thoughtful, from their service to the menu that changes every single night. Not everything is great - but it’s all interesting, and the dishes are unlike anything we’ve seen before. You might see beef tongue with a fruit and nut mole, $45 mashed potatoes topped with caviar, or a foie gras milkshake for dessert.",/philadelphia/reviews/river-twice,0.8776461057495133,535
"Bistro La Minette is a little too fancy for a casual weeknight meal, but not quite special enough to go out of your way for a celebration or important date night. What it is perfect for, though, is a first date at the bar during Happy Hour. Until 7pm every weeknight, they do $2 beers, $3 wines, $4 kirs, and half-priced appetizers. It’s exactly what you want for a low-commitment meeting when you aren’t sure exactly how the night’s going to play out.",/philadelphia/reviews/bistrot-la-minette,0.8333687910010638,1085
"If you live near Callowhill, then Prohibition Taproom should be your go-to neighborhood bar.

"The Thirsty Soul is a church-themed bar in Newbold with a menu of Southern bar food, and an all-day brunch on the weekends.

"The Sidecar used to be a pretty average dive bar in Graduate Hospital. Then it was taken over by the people behind Mike’s BBQ and Stockyard Sandwich Co. and now the food is great. There are things like Detroit-style pizza, a Nashville hot chicken sandwich, plus a burger that’s only $5 during Happy Hour.

"If you’re into beer, you’ll want to hang out downstairs at The International - where they have craft bottles, cans, and drafts from all over the world. Upstairs, on the other hand, you’ll find a bar made out of an old airplane wing and a menu of cocktails. Whichever floor you decide to spend your time on, though, you’ll be able to order food from their bar menu. It has things like charcuterie boards, sandwiches, and skewers (that are only $1 each during Happy Hour).",/philadelphia/reviews/the-international,0.846248855600743,755
"Maybe you’re having people over for the Eagles game, or maybe you’ve been craving wings since you smelled them at a bar the other night. Either way, Andy’s is the best place on South Street to go for fried chicken. Their double-fried Korean recipe results in an audible crunch, and the sweet chili sauce adds just the right amount of heat. If you’re taking it to go, make sure to call ahead to place your order. Also, it wouldn’t hurt to stock up on paper towels.",/philadelphia/reviews/andys-chicken-south-street,0.8538993213239993,207
"Kind of like Pat’s and Geno’s, Jim’s and Ishkabbible’s on South Street are often pitted against each other in “best of” cheesesteak competitions. They’re very similar, except instead of using straight whiz on their sandwiches, Ishkabibble’s uses a whiz-provolone mix that gives it an edge over Jim’s. They’re also known for their chicken cheesesteak, and a weird, purple lemonade drink called the “Gremlin” - but you should stick to a regular cheesesteak and a fountain soda.",/philadelphia/reviews/ishkabibbles-eatery,0.8943482172598529,915
"There’s a Rita’s and a Haagen-Dazs on South Street, but our favorite place for frozen dessert is Big Gay. Sure it’s a chain from New York, but their soft serve is incredible, and we’re especially fans of the Salty Pimp. It’s caramel-filled vanilla swirl on a cone, covered with pretzel pieces and dipped into a chocolate shell. There are other great options as well, like ice cream sandwiches and sundaes, but the Salty Pimp is what you should get on your first trip here.",/philadelphia/reviews/big-gay-ice-cream,0.8834225097749406,249
"Everything about Le Caveau feels cool. It’s the wine bar you’ve always wanted in your neighborhood - where you can walk in unannounced on a Thursday night with a date and immediately impress them just by knowing it exists. The dark, moody spot sits right above another of our favorite places, The Good King Tavern, and is like it’s sophisticated, cigarette-smoking sister who only dates older Italian men. Their wine list is primarily made up of natural bottles and is divided between “France” and “Not France.” There’s also a short menu of bar snacks with things like a hot dog wrapped in a baguette and salted chocolate mousse. You could probably order enough food to make a full dinner, but you should be coming here more for the wine and to feel like you’re cooler than you actually are.",/philadelphia/reviews/le-caveau,0.8663008677949092,311
"You’ll probably feel a little like you’re on a boat when you’re drinking at Misconduct Tavern with their vaulted and wood-paneled ceilings. But this Rittenhouse sports bar (which has a couple of other locations in the city) is a solid place to watch sports. They have a bunch of TVs and enough tables that you won’t have to hover behind some poor guy sitting at the bar for three hours. There’s a solid selection of beer, with taps that rotate every few weeks, and the burgers and wings are pretty decent too.",/philadelphia/reviews/misconduct-tavern,0.8380878149349691,682
"2nd Street Brew House looks like any other dive bar in the area, with a long bar and a few mismatched tables scattered around. But if you’re into beer, this is a great place to drink.

"Fermentary Form doesn’t have normal hours or a listed address, so the only way to know you’re in the right place is the green light hanging above their door. The alleyway door opens kind of randomly (you can find out when they’ll be open on their Instagram), and their tasting room can only fit 50 people at a time. Inside, it looks and feels like a brewery, with barrels stacked against the wall and taps behind the bar, but it technically isn’t one. Although they make beer, it’s brewed elsewhere and then delivered to their front door, where they spend all their time adding yeast and fermenting the beer. The result is several excellent sours that they rotate out every few months.",/philadelphia/reviews/fermentery-form,0.8444187280104365,1224

"Some of the best restaurants in the city get their baked goods from Lost Bread Co. But the Kensington bakery only opens its doors to the public on weekends, and when it does, it sells out of everything within hours - whether that’s loaves of sourdough or salty-sweet pretzel shortbread cookies.

The flavors change weekly, but range from classics like Boston creme to ones that sound like they were invented by a really hungry 9-year-old, like banana graham cracker and black and white cookie cake.

Starting on Thursday, though, the Midtown Village spot does a $25 pre-fixe brunch where you can bring your own champagne (they’ll supply the OJ).

And the new arrangement has been a huge plus for Passyunk Square. Now, you can sit at the countertop seating on the walls or one of the many tables, take a break from work, and grab a piece of orange ricotta cake with a cup of coffee. ,They also have some of the best sourdough in the city, including their flavored three-cheese loaf that blends parmesan, romano, and asiago. Even though they have an assortment of breakfast options, you should go for their breakfast sando deluxe that’s oozing with cheddar cheese.

It’s a place where you could end up sending your last email of the day on an early Friday and heading to Happy Hour at Cheu or another Fishtown spot. They serve everything from iced coffees, teas, macchiatos, and a few espresso drinks that will get you more amped up than the Pink Floyd albums on the wall.,

However, in addition to being the place where you pick up some $20 cheese before a dinner party, it’s also a good place to grab a few bottles of wine for your next BYOB date.

The only thing that everybody has in common here is that they’re all eating the same big plates of red-sauce pasta that costs less than a bottle of wine from Trader Joe’s. It might not be an ideal situation for the parents of the two-year-old, but neither is bringing your kids to the Princess Grande Playa resort during March. But people keep doing it anyway.",/philadelphia/reviews/la-fontana-della-citta,0.8895334425958351,1085
"Chinatown is a gold mine of party BYOBs - they’re everywhere, almost none of them charge a corkage fee, and the food is generally really good and inexpensive. Banana Leaf fits all those categories, making it the perfect place to pregame or even be the main event for the night. This small Malaysian spot has bamboo wallpaper and rows of tables that you can shove together if you have a big group. You have the option to order a la carte, but their pre-set menus are the best bet for groups. They come with around 10 courses of things like pad thai and beef rendang for less than $25 per person.",/philadelphia/reviews/banana-leaf-malaysian-cuisine,0.8550764408549412,955
"Going out to dinner with a big group of people always means dealing with lots of preferences and dietary restrictions. But Giorgio on Pine, a small Italian BYOB in Rittenhouse, has something for everyone - even gluten-free people who desperately want pasta. They’ll make any of their pastas gluten-free, and they have a ton of vegan and vegetarian options as well. Since that’s taken care of, you can spend less time quizzing your server on exactly what you can and can’t eat and more time drinking lots of wine.",/philadelphia/reviews/giorgio-on-pine,0.813265665221883,803
"Cafe Ynez looks like the love child of a New Jersey diner and a Mexican beachside hut. It has wood-paneled walls, turquoise booths, and strings of colorful lights hanging from the ceiling. In addition to the food, which ranges from things like $9 carnitas tacos to a $20 whole chicken, they also make all their own mixers in house. They have carafes of mango mint margarita mix to pair with your handle of tequila, and there’s also a blueberry thyme lemonade that you should mix with vodka to make a very inexpensive DIY cocktail.",/philadelphia/reviews/cafe-ynez,0.8781623586981357,1009
"This Center City sushi shop has a lot of neon lights, and there are pretty much zero rules about what you can bring in, how much noise you can make, or how many times you request that they change the playlist. They don’t have the best rolls in the city, but their spicy tuna and crunchy scallop rolls are decent, and they have lots of easily shareable appetizers like gyoza and vegetable tempura.",/philadelphia/reviews/crazy-sushi,0.8857978458806259,446
"On any given night at La Viola in Rittenhouse, you’ll see at least one table full of Penn students that stretches the length of the restaurant. Sometimes it’s undergrads pre-gaming a night out, and other times it’s a table of Wharton students following up a hockey game with a multi-course pasta feast. No matter who it is, though, they always come with approximately one bottle of wine per person to pair with some ricotta gnocchi, veal marsala, or salmon in a white wine sauce. That’s exactly how you want to do La Viola - show up hungry with lots of cheap wine, a big group of people you like, and a wad of cash (they don’t take cards).",/philadelphia/reviews/la-viola,0.8836410569281928,1246
"For a long time, Dim Sum Garden was the preferred dim sum spot for college students to get tipsy. However, as soon as they started charging a $15 corkage fee, all the kids figured out that they could take their backpacks full of cheap beer down the street to Tom’s. Almost a carbon copy of Dim Sum Garden, Tom's has a long menu of things like dumplings, rice plates, and pan-fried vegetables. They don’t generally take reservations, but if you have a big enough group you can reserve their back room.",/philadelphia/reviews/toms-dim-sum,0.6953682577998794,210
"You can expect a night at Casta Diva to follow a pretty standard schedule. Step one: walk in with a big group and a bunch of wine you just bought from the shop next door. Step two: take over half of the restaurant and make it your personal dining room for the night. Step three: order a pasta that ends in “i.” Step four: run out of wine midway through dinner and make at least one trip back to the wine store. Step five: repeat once a month, forever.",/philadelphia/reviews/caffe-casta-diva,0.8156509144790962,288
"Radicchio is the kind of Italian BYOB that exists on pretty much every corner in the city. But instead of paint on the walls, it has rows of wine corks that will make you wonder how much they had to drink to acquire all of the raw materials. The menu is full of solid pasta dishes like spaghetti positano and gnocchi al pomodoro. Also, it’s less expensive than other similar BYOBs, which makes Radicchio the perfect place for a last-minute date night on a Tuesday during an otherwise busy week.",/philadelphia/reviews/radicchio-cafe,0.8642030939946093,994
"There are a lot of great things about Herman’s - like all of the food trucks that are parked out front, and the daily 1900 Ice Cream pint deliveries. But the best thing might be that they have garage doors that stay open the whole summer, which makes it feel like you’re outside.

"The Monkey &amp; The Elephant in Brewerytown supports and employs people who grew up in the foster system.

"Ultimo Coffee, which has three locations in Philly, is in the camp of “trendy coffee shops.” It’s not elitist or snobby, and it’s actually casual and comfortable inside. Plus, this one in Newbold has a whole wall filled with beer refrigerators, just in case the coffee isn’t cutting it.

"Elixr’s roastery is a 2,000 square foot space in Callowhill, which makes it a great coffee shop for getting work done.

"The Rival Bros location on Spruce looks like an apartment you might inherit if you were one of Logan Roy’s heirs from Succession. It’s gorgeous, with high ceilings supported on pillars, painted-black walls, and dark leather booths you’ll want to remember when you finally design your Rittenhouse Square penthouse. The coffee is also some of the best in the city, and while the food menu is small, there are always pastries behind the counter from local bakeries.",/philadelphia/reviews/rival-bros-coffee-bar,0.8815049176680301,796
"You might not think that a soundtrack of mostly punk and heavy metal would be conducive to getting work done, but it’s shockingly more soothing than the elevator music you usually hear in coffee shops. The soundtrack, plus the fact that it’s filled with worn-in furniture, and feels so homey you might absentmindedly kick off your shoes. If you need some food along the way, they have an all-vegan menu with pastries and sandwiches along with a bunch of tea and coffee options.",/philadelphia/reviews/grindcore-house,0.8719853797415841,409
"There are a lot of great coffee shops in Fishtown, but most of them are tiny places that fill up quickly.

"Rally is a lot more than a coffee shop. It’s also an event space, a design studio, and a pop-up shop for local vendors. That makes it useful for a lot of different things, like distracting yourself from work by looking at all of the pretty pottery and greeting cards sitting on the shelves. If you’re coming here to get some work done, there are always a few tables available. Plus, you can also reserve their tables by the hour for a small fee, so if you need to have a team meeting, forget going to the packed Starbucks down the street.",/philadelphia/reviews/rally,0.8178066777100154,278
"Forsythia is a French restaurant in Old City from the people behind Will BYOB. In a lot of ways, it’s much different from Will. It’s not a BYOB for one - they have a long bar that’s constantly filled with people grabbing drinks or splitting a bottle from their great natural wine list. As far as the food goes, the menu is a la carte with mostly small plates like corn and ham hock beignets and mussels escabeche. For dessert, it’s absolutely necessary to order the two-tiered tower with pairs of raspberry macarons, coffee and coconut pots de creme, and more.",/philadelphia/reviews/forsythia,0.875192791312322,122
"If you need to impress someone, be it a client or a significant other, you should take them to Jean-Georges. The sprawling space is at the top of the newest Comcast Tower - on the 59th floor to be exact - and the 360-degree panoramic views of the entire city are enough to make even that guy from Free Solo feel a little uneasy. The menu here is French and heavy on the seafood, and while everything is very good, you should take this opportunity to order one of the three caviar dishes. They’re listed at the top of the menu under the title “Indulge,” and the one with meyer lemon gelee and creme fraiche is our personal favorite.",/philadelphia/reviews/jean-georges,0.8679006191648742,184
"Almost everyone that walks up to the counter at Little Thai Market gets the shrimp pad thai. And it makes sense - it’s sweet and just a little bit spicy, with thick, chewy noodles and a sprinkle of peanuts. But the best thing here is the salmon curry. It’s a piece of salmon on top of a heap of rice and broccoli, covered with a spicy curry sauce. It’s so delicious that even if the three people in front of you all choose the same bowl of pad thai, don’t be swayed - the salmon curry is the right decision.",/philadelphia/reviews/little-thai-market,0.8043223031063307,789
"Kamal’s looks more like a mini-market than it does an actual food stand, with shelves full of Middle Eastern spices and ingredients. So a lot of people walk right by without even taking a look at the menu plastered behind the counter. But you shouldn’t, because their homemade falafel, served on pita with chopped lettuce and a spread of hummus is a simple but great lunch. There’s also an eggplant stew that’s rich and savory, or if you can’t make up your mind, you can get a mezze plate with a bunch of different Middle Eastern salads and dips.",/philadelphia/reviews/kamals-middle-eastern-specialties,0.8308467289584449,804
"Profi’s isn’t your only option for a good crepe in Reading Terminal Market - it’s one of your only options for a good crepe in all of Philly. But if you don’t mind climbing through the tourist jungle to get here, it usually doesn’t have a line, and you can get your sweet or savory crepe in about three minutes flat. The crepes themselves are pretty standard, with a nice, stretchy pancake and a good amount of filling.

"You can skip everything at Loco Lucho’s except their great Cubano sandwich. It’s layered with roast pork, ham, melted swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard, and pressed between buttery bread. There’s almost never a line either, so you’re able to get your sandwich quickly.",/philadelphia/reviews/loco-luchos-latino-kitchen-1,0.874537851434429,812

"The longest line at Reading Terminal Market always seems to be at Carmen’s for their cheesesteak. What you really need at Carmen’s, though, is their Italian hoagie. The meats are piled high on fluffy white bread and covered in oil, vinegar, and a mix of salt and pepper. And it’s huge, so if you can’t finish it, you can always save the other half for dinner or for when you want a snack at 3pm.",/philadelphia/reviews/carmens-famous-italian-hoagies,0.8844700749416807,812
"The pretzels at Miller’s Twist are incredible. They’re fluffier than your average Philly soft pretzel, with crispy outsides covered in big pieces of salt, but they rip like cinnamon buns fresh from the oven. You can get them plain or covered in cinnamon-sugar, but the best thing to order is one of their pretzel-covered hot dogs. It’s an all-beef dog wrapped in melted cheese and a pretzel bun, and it’s essentially the best version of carnival food.",/philadelphia/reviews/millers-twist,0.8691158843843367,936
"Termini Brothers is probably the most famous bakery in Philly - and rightfully so because they make some of the best pastries, cakes, and cannolis in the city.

"If you’re at Reading Terminal Market on a weekend, you should be getting breakfast at Dutch Eating Place. They serve lunch as well, but what they do best are pancakes, eggs, and breakfast meats.

"If you find yourself at Reading Terminal Market in the morning, whether you’re with visiting relatives or just on your way to work, you’re going to want to stop at Smucker’s. Their breakfast sandwiches are without a doubt one of the best things in the market. They come on big, fluffy kaiser rolls and are stacked with melty cheese, layers of perfectly cooked eggs, and your choice of breakfast meat. If you happen to be here later in the day, their roast beef, which is slow-roasted and cooked in its own gravy, is also excellent.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-grill-at-smuckers,0.8344696013852101,69
"There might be other places in Reading Terminal Market that serve ice cream, but none of them matter besides Bassett’s. The stand has been in the same place at the front of the market since 1892, which means it predates college basketball, the rotary dial, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. All of their flavors are super rich and creamy, like butter pecan, raspberry truffle, and a kind-of-spicy cinnamon. They usually have a line, but it moves quickly, so don’t wander off just because the bakery across the way has no wait.",/philadelphia/reviews/bassetts-ice-cream,0.8744791512719781,7
"The Rib Stand does one thing really well - dry-rubbed ribs. There’s really nothing else on the menu, besides a couple of sides and bottled sodas. And there isn’t anywhere to sit, so you’ll have to take your messy, fall-off-the-bone ribs elsewhere to eat them. But once you get your plate of baby back ribs, mac and cheese, coleslaw, and a cup of either mild or spicy BBQ sauce, you won’t care where or how you’re eating it.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-rib-stand,0.8317435005971181,805
"Walking through Reading Terminal can be overwhelming, and you’ll probably see at least 20 different things sitting on display that you’ll immediately want to order. But at Hershel’s, once you see the huge slabs of corned beef and pastrami being cut behind the counter, there’s no way you’re leaving without a sandwich. That’s a good thing, though, because a pastrami on rye, maybe with some mustard, is the best thing on the menu. The meat is tender, the bread is perfectly toasted, and it’s easily transported somewhere far away from here, where you can eat it without someone waiting for you to give up your table.",/philadelphia/reviews/hershels-east-side-deli,0.8970123511802938,519
"Goldie is a fast-casual falafel shop from the people behind Zahav and Federal Donuts. In addition to their main Rittenhouse location, they also have an outpost at Franklin’s Table. Their menu is pretty short, with sandwiches, salads, and fries, but that’s because they do one thing really well - falafel. It’s crispy and full of spices, and you can get it with a few different sauces, but the harissa is our favorite. Also, you should save room for a tehina milkshake - they substitute ice cream and milk with tehina and coconut whip, and it tastes better than most dairy milkshakes.",/philadelphia/reviews/goldie-1,0.8719916703525782,930
"Koch’s Deli has been handing out sample deli meats in long lines since Ronald Reagan was just a California governor hopeful. It’s easily the best place in University City to get a sandwich, especially if you like meat. They’ll pile up to four different types of thinly-cut meats in between fluffy Italian rolls, resulting in a sandwich so thick you’ll momentarily wish you could unhinge your jaw like a snake. And, if somehow you’re still hungry, you should get one of their thick, creamy vanilla milkshakes to finish off your meal.",/philadelphia/reviews/kochs-deli,0.8392815853298781,428
"In addition to being a dog on PBS who taught literary history to children in the ‘90s, Wishbone is also a fried chicken restaurant in University City. They batter their chicken in buttermilk and a crunchy pretzel coating, and it’s completely delicious whether you get it in wing form or as a basket of chicken tenders. It’s a fast-casual place, so there aren’t a ton of tables inside, but if it’s a nice day there are usually a few tables outside where you can chase your spicy donfire sauce-covered wings with a fountain soda.",/philadelphia/reviews/wishbone,0.8392342881298192,3
"Yes, Shake Shack is a country-wide burger chain. Regardless, it’s still a great option for a quick meal in University City. The burgers are great, the cheese fries are even better, and if you leave without finishing all of that off with a milkshake, you’ve done it all wrong. You might not feel great afterwards, but that’s the gamble you take when you eat a large amount of fast food in a 30-minute sitting.",/philadelphia/reviews/shake-shack-4,0.8692588035244075,788

This location on Locust Street has a menu that rotates with the season, but you can always find a good selection of vegan and vegetarian sandwiches, as well as things like turkey croissants and roast beef wraps.

They also have a location at Franklin Table, Penn’s sort-of-new food hall, where you can get the same quality sushi in about 3 minutes flat instead of sitting down for an entire meal. They don’t have exactly the same selection at their to-go window that you’ll find at Double Knot, but you can still get a great box of sushi or sashimi with sauces, rice, and edamame. And, if you have about 30 minutes on your hands, they have a $35 mini-omakase that’s a step up from any other lunch available in the food hall.",/philadelphia/reviews/dk-sushi,0.8630201299632813,73
"The perfect New York Slice should be cheap, large, and cheesy with just the right amount of grease droplets. That’s exactly the kind of pizza they have at Lorenzo’s. This South Street deli makes huge, 20-inch pies with slices that fold in half like there’s a perforated line down the middle and taste good even when they’re just reheated from the window case.

Their pies are square, with sweet, bright-red tomato sauce and just the right amount of mozzarella cheese. You should go in person to their original Italian Market location, but they deliver from all four of their Philly locations.

It’s your average divey sports bar, with sticky barstools, $2 beers, and a makeshift stage where they have live music and weekly quizzo. However, the best part about this dive is that it’s also home to Enjay’s Pizza. This pizza spot is just a couple of couple guys cooking out of the Smokey Joe’s kitchen, but their wood-fired pies are perfectly charred with bubbly crusts.

Other than the Khyber gumbo, which is perfectly meaty and just a little spicy, they also have a ton of po’boys on the menu, as well as beignets at brunch that almost live up to the ones at Cafe Du Monde. They also have live music in their upstairs venue space, so you might as well just invite all your friends here for dinner and have a slightly-less-aggressive version of your college Mardi Gras experience.",/philadelphia/reviews/khyber-pass-pub,0.8820245199054758,71
"Interstate is well-known for its alcoholic iced tea mixture that’s so strong they’ll only let you order two of them. But what it should be known for is its seriously good southern-inspired bar food like pecan-panko crusted chicken fingers and catfish tacos.

"The best thing about Fountain Porter in East Passyunk is that it serves a $5 burger at all times. And while this burger is pretty simple, with a lettuce-tomato-onion combo on a sesame seed bun, it has a perfectly-cooked patty that hits the spot. Besides the burger, you should come here for the long draft list, which changes every night, as well as the affordable wines by the glass and bottle. You’ll need to check their Instagram to know exactly what’s on tap, or you could just go in blind and be surprised - you won’t disappoint either way.",/philadelphia/reviews/fountain-porter,0.8701334234287954,1373
"Elwood is a meat-heavy Pennsylvania-Dutch-inspired spot on Girard in Fishtown. Eating there kind of feels like being on a second-grade field trip to the Constitution Center or Liberty Bell. Everything on the menu, from the ham potpie to the spelt dumplings for dessert, has a history lesson attached - lessons you’ll probably hear about from the chef or your server throughout the meal. Even the space itself, which has original paintings from the 1800s and antique silverware collected by the chef, makes you feel like you’re in a museum. The whole experience can feel a bit strange at first, but the food is so good that you’ll be happy you took a field trip out here.",/philadelphia/reviews/elwood,0.8804827369067861,857

But aside from the trendy decor, it’s a pretty laid-back space with good, strong cocktails for $10 each and a short menu of things like ribs and something called a crack chicken sandwich. It’s a solid place to drink a few mojitos with friends, especially if you want to pretend you’re on a tropical island.",/philadelphia/reviews/germantown-garden,0.8817788665999985,508

This place pours a bunch of wines from next door (both by the glass and bottle), plus they have a large selection of beer and cocktails - including one with a rose popsicle dunked in champagne.

But, more importantly, Pagano’s has a huge outdoor patio that turns into a mob scene during SIPS in the summer. It has a huge fountain that we’ve personally watched more than a few people fall into after a couple of beers, and there’s a large Jumbotron screen that shows Phillies games and World Cup soccer.

The first floor is more of a pub, with lots of tables and a small food menu with things like chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks. But the second floor is entirely different.

Come here if you want to grab a quick bite between classes, or for a take out dinner when you can’t seem to summon the strength to make it to the grocery store.

Along with a full bar that gets pretty crowded on most nights, the restaurant also has a ton of events where everyone who shows up already seems to be friends.

"For halal food in West Philly, Hadramout is a great option. It’s a small Yemeni spot down the street from Penn’s campus that makes huge sheets of tandoor bread - you’ll want to order extra of it to eat with anything off the menu. Get some of their creamy hummus, a super flavorful lamb soup, or a whole fish that changes depending on what’s fresh. Even though the restaurant is small, there are a few big booths that can fit bigger parties - so you can bring a bunch of friends and order half the menu to share.",/philadelphia/reviews/hadramout,0.8679587457285969,788
"Ambra is right next door to Southwark and is owned by the same people, but serves Italian food and feels much more upscale. The tiny, 16-seat restaurant has only one option - a four-course tasting menu for $72 - with things like squid ink spaghetti and Sicilian lamb breast, plus a complimentary glass of champagne when you first arrive. If you want to continue drinking wine after you finish your free glass, they also have one of the better lists in the city - with a focus on Italian reds.",/philadelphia/reviews/restaurant-ambra,0.8681153888685538,311
"If you’re spending a couple of days down the Shore, the last thing you want to do is waste precious time running errands. Finding places where you can check two boxes, like getting a meal and some needed weekend groceries, can help you maximize your ability to grab your board and catch those perfect waves between high and low tide. Lovelandtown is one of those spots. Outside, you can get a classic cold lobster roll piled high with lobster meat, fresh herbs, capers, and a squeeze of lemon from a 1955 Chevy truck that’s outfitted with a kitchen. And inside, the small grocery store has a great coffee bar and a deli/butcher that offers fantastic hot and cold sandwiches to go, along with all the essentials to stock your fridge with for the next few days.",/philadelphia/reviews/lovelandtown-grocery-provisions-bay-head,0.8598229694764259,914
"Whether you need a break from winning your kids stuffed animals at Fantasy Island, or you just want a fun spot to drink some really good beers, you should go to Ship Bottom Brewery. This big brewery and bar overlooking the square in Bay Village serves about 10 beers that are brewed on site, which you can try as part of different tasting flights, like “The Wipeout” that includes just about all of them. It’s also BYO food, so bring some gigantic slices from Bay Village Pizza next door, and drink some really good beers while listening to live music, which they have most days during the summer.",/philadelphia/reviews/ship-bottom-brewery-lbi,0.8552763427288924,536
"George’s Place has been around since the ’60s, and it serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week. We like it best in the morning because it’s one of the few places in Cape May where you can walk in unannounced, wait less than 10 minutes, and sit down for some reliably great Greek-ish food. Their breakfast menu is huge, with things like an herb-and-brie omelet and limoncello french toast. And, if you come in for lunch, don’t skip the lemon chicken Greek salad.",/philadelphia/reviews/georges-place-cape-may,0.8783327053394926,257
"If you have an uncle, cousin, or just distant family friend who staunchly believes that not enough people have looked their dinner in the face before eating it, then you should bring them to Beach Plum Farm. Everything you eat here comes directly from the land it sits on, and you’re encouraged to walk around and hang out with the pigs and cows before you sit down at one of their Saturday night farm-to-table dinners. They set tables on the grass, cook most of the meat in front of you in an outdoor fire pit, and serve everything family-style. It’ll cost you about $90 per person, but for the most fun dinner experience you’ll have all summer, it’s more than worth the money.",/philadelphia/reviews/beach-plum-farm,0.811709423794513,643
"When Cracker Barrel decided on their general-store-plus-country-restaurant concept, what they were probably hoping they’d end up with was something very similar to The Red Store. This spot in Cape May Point manages to be both a very good general store - with some of the best pastries and pies around - and an incredible full-service restaurant. Their kitchen does everything from breakfast to dinner, and even though you’ll walk through a bakery and a row of birthday cards to get to your table, the $65 tasting menu is unlike any other tasting menu you’ll get down the Shore and changes regularly based on what's in season.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-red-store-cape-may,0.873438324135935,212
"There’s normal Shore breakfast, and then there’s The Mad Batter. At the former, you show up to a cute diner, order something classic, and then take your handwritten check up to a counter and pay $15 per person for your meal. At the Mad Batter, you show up with a big group of friends, order either a manmosa or a pint glass filled with something called “shipwreck punch” (both of which have a two-per-person limit), fill the space leftover from the drinks in your stomach with a lox bagel, and then roll yourself to the beach and pass out for a few hours. It’s not something you can do every morning, but when it happens, you’re happy it did.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-mad-batter-cape-may,0.8620055873830381,69
"At any given time, there’s a lot going on at Rusty Nail. From the bar inside to the huge sandlot out back to the nightly live music, it’s a lot to take in. But for a casual dinner-and-a-beer situation in Cape May, there aren’t many better places you can go to. Start with a plate of barbecue at a table surrounded by Adirondack chairs, and then hang out by the fire pit until the bartender reminds you that all the people you came with left hours ago.",/philadelphia/reviews/rusty-nail-cape-may,0.8978862968130891,1160
"If you like your seafood fresh, steamed, and otherwise untouched, go to H&amp;H. It’s a little shack with a deck that sits on the bay, and they serve everything they’ve caught that day on trays for you to bring to one of their picnic tables and season yourself. Get a steamed lobster and ask for some clarified butter on the side, or go for one of their all-you-can-eat crab feasts, where you’ll get a shaker of Old Bay and a basket of tools to break the shells open.",/philadelphia/reviews/hh-seafood-cape-may,0.8636108046371859,1006
"Surfside looks like pretty much every other breakfast spot down the Shore. It has a ’60s feel, with wood-beam ceilings, teal (the 1964 Pantone Color of the Year, we assume) accents everywhere, and a full-wall mural of the Wildwood boardwalk that looks like a particularly talented second-grader painted it. But unlike the other breakfast places in town, Surfside has really good food that doesn’t just stick to the standards you’ll find everywhere else. There are fluffy lemon-ricotta pancakes, macadamia nut french toast, and a Greek dish called “The Hangover,” with eggs, chipped beef, tomato, spinach, and feta that will bring you back from whatever you got into the night before.",/philadelphia/reviews/surfside-west-diner-wildwood,0.8348317927043345,177
"We could give you an entire history lesson on the Mack and Manco families - one of the most dramatic Jersey Shore stories of all time - but instead we’ll just tell you this: Mack’s in Wildwood is essentially the same as Manco &amp; Manco’s in Ocean City. It has the same huge, cheesy slices of pizza, the same long lines out front, and even the same light-up signs hanging outside of their boardwalk location. The only real distinction is that if you’re in Ocean City, you go to Manco’s, and if you’re in Wildwood, you go to Mack’s.",/philadelphia/reviews/macks-pizza-wildwood,0.8870439891165178,1073
"You’re going to wait in line at Springer’s, even if you come right when it opens at noon. But, given that they have over 50 homemade and perfect ice cream flavors at a time, it’s worth standing in line for. Plus, it goes pretty quickly, so really it’s the perfect amount of time needed to narrow the 50 flavors down to just the three you can fit in the biggest size they have.",/philadelphia/reviews/springers-homemade-ice-cream-stone-harbor,0.863618767507913,158
"At some point during the summer, you and your friends or family should commit to waiting on Quahog’s patio for bowls of the moqueca (Brazilian fish stew) and the pacu fish ribs. But on most days, Quahog’s is best for a quick lunch on the way to the beach. Instead of heading out back, go through the side door that says “taco shop” on it where you can order tacos, burritos, quesadillas, or bowls with your choice of filling. The mahi-mahi tacos are always our pick, but the shrimp and pork shoulder are solid options as well.",/philadelphia/reviews/quahogs-seafood-shack-stone-harbor,0.8830866297177993,1152
"When people make fun of Avalon for being bougie, they’re talking about places like The Reeds, which is about as fancy a hotel as you’ll find on the Jersey Shore. But unlike Sax, the super-upscale hotel restaurant where they probably ask if you’d prefer your water filtered or straight from the mouth of a glacial river, Water Star Grille is a much less formal spot in the back of the hotel where you’ll actually want to hang out. The huge deck is covered in turf and looks out over the bay, and during lunch hours, the tables are covered in umbrellas so you don’t melt into your chair. The best time to come here, though, is as the sun’s going down for dinner. The views are great, the small-plates menu rarely has a miss, and the whole place feels like what the Hamptons would be if the whole island somehow migrated 200 miles south for the summer.",/philadelphia/reviews/water-star-grille,0.85488363981471,1224
"The Diving Horse is a BYO spot right on the main stretch of Dune, and it basically feels like you’re going over to your friend’s beach house - that is, if your friends cooked anything other than burgers. Like most other Shore restaurants, the focus here is on seafood, but they also have a smoked pork chop with a caramel glaze that’ll have you wishing you could put the entire restaurant in your pocket and bring it home with you for the winter. If you have a big enough group and call early enough, ask for one of the few patio tables out back when the weather’s nice. And since it’s right across the street from the Princeton, you already know where you’ll be ending your night afterward.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-diving-horse-avalon,0.8601388902266272,642
"If you’re thinking about opening a pizza place down the Shore, don’t do it in Avalon. Or Stone Harbor for that matter. Everyone already has their favorite pizza place, and it’s Circle. Circle Pizza is a pretty standard spot, with large pies topped with the classic pepperoni or mushrooms and onions, and huge fountain sodas that will make their way, half-full, into your fridge when you get home. But due to how simultaneously greasy and crunchy their slices are, this indoor/outdoor spot has a fanatical following. You’ll find just as many people here at 2pm on a beach break as you will at 2am after the bars close down - though everyone will likely be wearing the same amount of clothing as if they had just gotten out of the water.",/philadelphia/reviews/circle-pizza-avalon,0.8290393045703568,1230
"There aren’t that many fancy date-night restaurants in Sea Isle City, but if you want to go out and have a nicer meal on the island, it should be at La Finestra. It’s an Italian spot right on the water with lots of classics (focus on the pasta and seafood dishes) and a candle-lit dining room that’s best used for a summertime date night. After you finish sharing the pappardelle with short rib ragu, you and the only person you trust to put sunscreen on your back without missing any spots can head to the beach and watch the stars while “Summer Nights” plays somewhere in the distance.",/philadelphia/reviews/la-finestra-sea-isle-city,0.8675072098037288,854
"Most of the time, eating at the Jersey Shore consists of finding things that are easy, cheap, and can quickly be consumed on the beach before a seagull has the chance to scoop it right out of your hands.

"There are two ways you can do Mike’s. You can wait in line, place an order, sit down, and then wait for another 30 to 40 minutes for your buckets of fried seafood to arrive. Or, you can place an order over the phone, pick everything up with no wait, and take it all home to dig into in the privacy of your beach house. Unless you’re someone who enjoys chaos, the latter is the way to go. You’ll get the same tins filled with battered fish and crab claws doused in Old Bay, but without being stepped on by people still in their bathing suits and squeaky rubber flip flops.",/philadelphia/reviews/mikes-seafood-sea-isle-city,0.8633331381484779,1074
"Right down the street from Smitty’s is The Crab Trap, a large, diner-looking place with an even longer wait than Smitty’s. And while you probably shouldn’t give up too many beach days to wait in line for a bucket of crabs, you should sacrifice a particularly gray one to leave the Shore early and get in line before the dinner crew shows up. Their seafood is all delicious and turned into things like deviled clams and honey-glazed salmon.

"If the only reason you’ve ever found yourself in Somers Point is to buy liquor, you’re not alone. But another place worth making a trip for is Smitty’s. It’s a small shack right on the banks of the bay with bar seats that wrap around the perimeter, and on most days there’s about an hour or so wait. But if you bring a cooler with a few beers (yes, people really do this) and maybe a bag of chips to tide you over, it’ll be worth the wait for a bowl of clam chowder, baked scallops, and pretty much anything that’s been put through the deep fryer.",/philadelphia/reviews/smittys-clam-bar-somers-point,0.8495945915067511,656
"There are a bunch of good places to get ice cream in Ocean City. There are even a lot of really good places. But if you were to play a word association game with your friends out on your Wesley Ave deck, and the prompt was “ice cream,” 10 out of 10 times their immediate reaction would be to yell “Kohr Bros.” This soft-serve spot with a few locations on the boardwalk has been around longer than most people on the boardwalk have been alive, and is known for its twists. In addition to the classic vanilla/chocolate combo, they have options like orange sherbet/vanilla, mint/chocolate, and peanut butter/chocolate.

Formerly known as Mack &amp; Manco’s (and still called that by half the island), Manco &amp; Manco’s looks like pretty much every other counter-service pizza shop on the boardwalk. Except that it’s not, it’s better.

The tiny, take-out-only Italian place has been around since 1954, and neither the menu nor the space has really changed in its over 65 years on the planet. They have everything from perfectly crispy veal parmesan to pasta fagioli soup that you’ll be dreaming about six months later when you’re in full winter hibernation. They don’t do delivery or internet orders, so you’ll have to place your order the traditional way: by talking on the phone to a real person and showing up 20 minutes later to pick it all up.",/philadelphia/reviews/voltacos-ocean-city,0.8752123586100227,872
"Our thoughts on breakfast in Ocean City are simple. If you want donuts, go to Brown’s; if you want anything else, go to Uncle Bill’s. There are a few locations down the Shore and they’re all pretty much the same, with not only the best pancakes in the area (get the chocolate chip ones), but also some of the better omelets you’ll find. There will likely be a bunch of groups waiting for tables on most summer mornings, but they move people in and out super quickly, so the wait is usually shorter than what the host tells you when you sign in.",/philadelphia/reviews/uncle-bills-pancake-house-ocean-city,0.8988345532035339,642
"If there’s one reason to wake up before 8am on a summer Saturday morning, it’s to make it to Brown’s before the line is so long that you can barely see the boardwalk shack from the end of it. Pretty much everyone knows about this place, so if you arrive past 9:30am, there will be layers of bicycles lined up across the boardwalk and lines both to sit down for breakfast and to take donuts to go. But once you’ve waited, you’ll be rewarded with the best donuts on the entire Shore. They’re cakey on the inside, crispy on the outside, and served hot in six flavors, like vanilla, honey, and cinnamon sugar. The breakfast itself is also solid, but mostly it’s just a way to skip the much-longer to-go line and get your donuts brought to a table instead.",/philadelphia/reviews/browns-restaurant-ocean-city,0.8799403827438735,69
"There are two things you need to know about Downbeach Deli. One is that you don’t want to actually go to the deli there - Dino’s is a far superior spot for hoagies and lunchmeat. But the second is that they have one of the best and cheapest breakfasts in Margate. You can get a full breakfast with an omelet, toast, and hashbrowns, or french toast made with carrot cake or cinnamon babka, for under $10. Either way, you’ll leave with enough change in your pocket to buy an extra six-pack to bring to the beach.",/philadelphia/reviews/downbeach-deli-margate,0.7249654823220271,428
"A few times every summer, you’ll pack all your bags, throw one of those beach chair backpacks over your shoulder, and drag everything five blocks to the beach, only to realize as soon as you get there that you left your lunch sitting in the fridge at home. Instead of heading all the way back and wasting another 45 minutes of peak sun time, give Dino’s a call and order a sandwich right to whatever beach you happen to be sitting on.

Otherwise, you can cross your fingers and pray that something opens up at 5pm on a Wednesday. But if you do get in, it’s one of the best meals you’ll have in the entire state of New Jersey.

"Tomatoes is a pretty strange place. It serves mostly American food, but also has sushi, and while it looks like a nicer restaurant, it turns into a rowdy bar once the dinner crowd leaves at 10pm. Despite its inability to decide what it wants to be, Tomatoes has always been a staple down the Shore. Most of the food is great - even the sushi - and it can work for pretty much any occasion, whether it’s a first date with someone you met playing flip cup at Maynard’s the night before or a family dinner with some insanely picky 10-year-olds.",/philadelphia/reviews/tomatoes-margate,0.8905392634121755,1085

Which brings us back to Chef Vola’s, where the veal milanese is near-perfect. It’s almost impossible to get a reservation at this 95-year-old spot, but if you know someone - or at least can convince them you know someone - you shouldn’t pass up the chance to eat some seriously amazing red-sauce Italian food in a Boardwalk Empire-era basement.",/philadelphia/reviews/chef-volas-atlantic-city,0.8682443894216829,541

It’s in an odd location just west of Bradley Beach and has an appetizer menu with everything from crab risotto and ratatouille-topped ricotta toast to chicken nuggets.

This place makes the best pizza south of Jersey City, but it’s not uncommon that an oven’s out, a fridge is down, or they’re simply out of dough.

And then inside, there’s a small restaurant where you can get lobster mac and cheese, seafood pastas, and whatever got pulled out of the water that morning.

It’s impossible to go wrong here, but the sandwiches, eggplant pie, or any of their daily specials from the chef’s case are what you want.",/philadelphia/reviews/joe-leones-point-pleasant,0.8641674357113474,834
"We may never get a consensus on it being pork roll or Taylor ham (it’s Taylor ham, by the way). But what we can all agree on is that Frank’s Deli is among the best places to get it in New Jersey, which actually means any other place on earth. Part deli and part diner, Frank’s has been an Asbury Park staple since before The Boss and his E-Street Band were rocking the Stone Pony on the other side of town. Go for breakfast and get their thick-cut pork roll with egg and cheese on a housemade roll. While you’re at it, grab a deli sandwich for lunch and take it to the beach. You might not think you’re hungry after all that pork roll, but you’ll thank us later.",/philadelphia/reviews/franks-deli-asbury-park,0.8230826476985593,428
"This three-floor party fortress has been standing strong for more than 135 years and is the perfect place to go for cheap lobsters, steamers, and sliders as you transition from work to a weekend down the Shore. Walk past the reservation-only front porch and go straight to the outside bar in the back before you hit the basement for live music. Definitely come here on the early side, as the Parker House is known for day drinking, huge crowds, and long lines, and due to a long-standing town ordinance, last call is at 11:30pm.",/philadelphia/reviews/parker-house-sea-girt,0.853481083631833,588
"After a long night out on the Jersey Shore, you’ll be lucky if you reach down and still find $1.35 in your pocket. It’s likely that, aside from all the beer and late-night slices, you spent those last few quarters playing NBA Jam at the old arcade next to your favorite boardwalk bar. Nevertheless, we hope that you can scrape the pot and find that buck and change to cross the bridge to OB-CO’s to grab a ‘sugar raised,’ which is one of the best donuts around. Lines can get long, so be prepared to wait, but the powdered croissants, lemon-filled, and Boston creams will be worth it.

"You’re on vacation, and on vacation, you get to eat cake for breakfast. Mueller’s is one of our favorite places to stop by because of their incredible crumb cake. They make other pastries too, and we’re sure they’re good, but you can go ahead and waste your time on those while we pick every sweet, meatball-sized crumb off your piece when you’re not looking.",/philadelphia/reviews/muellers-bakery,0.8859289504408636,1039
"At some point, you’ll likely be a part of someone’s first visit to the Jersey Shore. Naturally, they’ll want to experience “the boardwalk” and there’s a chance that boardwalk will be in Seaside Heights. Skip the 64 oz. lemonade and fried Oreos and head to Midway, the center-of-the-boardwalk cheesesteak stand. It’s not fancy, it’s barely scenic, but it is definitely iconic for its colorful exterior, open-air grills with rows of grilling steak, piles of peppers and onions, and massive cups of salty french fries. This far north of Philadelphia, you won’t do better than Midway.",/philadelphia/reviews/midway-steak-seaside-heights,0.8843087507512933,207
"Although the juice and acai bowl shops try their best, the Jersey Shore breakfast scene hasn’t changed much. There are still plenty of bagel shops to stop at for egg sandwiches, marina-side cafe’s that serve as one-stop shops for fisherman to get omelets and bait and tackle, and of course, tchotchke-filled pancake houses. And along the northern Shore, we’re yet to find any pancakes that beat the ones at John and Elaine’s. Pair those hotcakes with their juicy breakfast sausage, which, if snapped loud enough, can drown out the political opinions blaring from the TV above their counter that you definitely didn’t order with your eggs.",/philadelphia/reviews/john-elaines-point-pleasant,0.8670527761030872,268
"You no doubt have a friend that will invite you to their “shore house” this summer and after hours of driving, you’ll find yourself in a beachless neighborhood on the west side of the Barnegat Bay in Toms River. The bad news is that your assumed summer beach adventure has led you to a land of strip malls you could have found 15 minutes over the George Washington Bridge. But the good news is that Brooklyn Square Pizza is nearby. This place specializes in square pies, layered with pecorino on top of slightly sweet sauce and mozzarella on a big cloud of dough dusted with sesame seeds. It’s like taking the subway to Bensonhurst, but without having to deal with the N train delays from midtown.",/philadelphia/reviews/brooklyn-square-pizza-toms-river,0.9128385770377306,1231
"While the Shore features no shortage of seagulls or sweaty beachside dance clubs, it does lack proper places to eat and drink like an adult - especially when you’re celebrating a birthday, anniversary, or just the fact that you were smart enough to hop on route 18 to skip miles of traffic. Pascal &amp; Sabine is a rare exception. This is one of the best restaurants in Asbury Park and makes great cocktails, has a solid wine list, and serves delicious French-inspired food. This is a good place to order lots of things to share, like the excellent pork chop and a variety of local seafood, which will give you plenty to discuss when your bathing suit doesn’t fit poolside the next day.",/philadelphia/reviews/pascal-sabine-asbury-park,0.8712805984170714,376
"Like the Jets and the Giants or the Statue of Liberty, there’s a long debate as to whether New York or New Jersey can claim Kohr’s Frozen Custard as its own. This place started in Coney Island, but that signature orange and vanilla custard swirl was perfected up and down the boardwalks of the Jersey Shore.

"Everyone knows that setting a calendar reminder 28 days in advance is the only way to get a reservation at Pizzeria Beddia in Philly or Carbone in Manhattan, but you should also keep it in mind if you plan on eating at Black Eyed Susans in Harvey Cedars. This BYOB spot is constantly packed with people celebrating special occasions, like a kid’s completion of freshman year, or an anniversary (while their freshman kid raids their liquor cabinet back at the house). The reason this white tablecloth restaurant is constantly slammed is the seafood-focused American food, like doughy, charred gnocchi with big chunks of lobster, and tender tilefish over thick vichyssoise.",/philadelphia/reviews/black-eyed-susans-lbi,0.91390518275552,816
"Even though you’re officially on vacation, it can take a while to forget about real life issues like incompetent bosses and forgotten Netflix passwords. The best way to snap yourself into “vacation mode” on LBI is to head to The Chicken Or The Egg (Chegg) in Beach Haven. It’s a 24/7 (from Memorial Day to Labor Day) diner that’s constantly packed with groups who seem to have gotten the memo on the implicit dress code of tank tops and flip-flops. The menu is huge, ranging from six-egg omelets to a reuben with not-too-salty, housemade corned beef. This place also serves some of the best buffalo wings we’ve ever had, which are offered naked or breaded and tossed in your choice of 18 different sauces (the naked wings with zapper sauce is our go-to order). When we say that the ludicrous (spiciest) sauce is a day-ruiner, you should trust us.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-chicken-or-the-egg-lbi,0.8596140121033095,1054
"We may not have been close friends with the kid at school who had the party house, but we still hung out there every afternoon in the summer. Tucker’s Tavern feels like that kid’s house, and the huge square bar in the middle of this spot in Beach Haven is where you should find yourself during Happy Hour (3-7pm every day). Their Bloody Marys are topped with jumbo shrimp, bacon, and blue cheese-stuffed olives, and they go great with a basket of wings and $1 oysters. Like at the party house in high school, there’s usually someone playing guitar in the corner, and there’s a roof where you can watch the sunset with someone who you asked to prom (15 years ago).",/philadelphia/reviews/tuckers-tavern-lbi,0.862142782254214,1036
"Parker’s Garage is from the same people as Mud City, Old Causeway, and a few spots on this side of the bridge, and like all of those places, the food here is very heavy and very enjoyable. Start with lobster corn dogs or croquettes filled with New England clam chowder, and then get the biscuits and gravy, which is a big plate of fried oysters and andouille topped with creamy gravy and a biscuit the size of whatever paperback you’re planning on reading at the beach. What makes Parker’s different from those spots, and really from anywhere else on the island, is its space. The big, open-air dining room is right on the water in Beach Haven, and all of the tables inside, as well as on the dock outside, have sunset views over the water. Enjoy them with a date or group, while drinking, well, anything you want (it’s BYOB).",/philadelphia/reviews/parkers-garage-oyster-saloon-lbi,0.8727483655241637,1305
"There’s going to be a wait at Mustache Bill’s, but whether you need to rock, paper, scissors for who has to go early and put a name in or you plan to kill time by cheating at mini-golf across the street, you should find a way to eat here. This cash-only diner near the lighthouse in Barnegat Light feels like it probably hasn’t changed much since it opened in the ’50s, with simple green swivel stools at the counter and a few booths lining the wall of the narrow space. It’s open from 6am-3pm, with a huge menu that ranges from eggs and pancakes to cheesesteaks and fried seafood platters, but no matter what you order, you’re going to leave full and happy. You can maximize both of those feelings by getting the “bombed eggs,” a massive plate of grits, gravy, and chipped beef topped with a few over-easy eggs.",/philadelphia/reviews/mustache-bills-lbi,0.8719360508734144,1124
"Old Causeway isn’t technically on LBI, but before you insult our geography skills, know that we already heard it all in sixth-grade homeroom, and it still belongs on this guide. Not only is it the last turn before the bridge, but they also have a private shuttle that you can call to take you to and from the island. As the name suggests, there are steaks and oysters on the menu, and you won’t be upset ordering either here, but our favorite thing to get at dinner is the karate-chop pork chop doused in a pineapple-soy glaze. You could also just come for Happy Hour (3-6pm), have a few drinks at the bar, and eat some spice-rubbed wings and jersey devils (deviled eggs topped with fried oysters).",/philadelphia/reviews/the-old-causeway-steak-oyster-house-lbi,0.8353726461507649,1024
"Black Whale is less than a block from Parker’s Garage, and both spots are from the same team, but deciding between the two is pretty straightforward. If you want dinner, go to Parker’s Garage, and if you want drinks and snacks, go to Black Whale. This walk-in-only spot (except for groups of eight or more) is almost always packed, but if you get there early enough or wait around long enough, you’ll be able to get a high-top or seats at the horseshoe bar. This is an especially good move during Happy Hour (3-6pm on weekdays), when there are $3 beers, $4 wine and well drinks, and discounted food, like $1 oysters and big plates of not-overly-fried calamari.",/philadelphia/reviews/black-whale-bar-fishhouse-lbi,0.8863981606501716,1151
"Most of New Jersey’s key food groups - pork roll, hoagies, and disco fries just to name a few - are well represented on LBI. But there isn’t a ton of red sauce Italian food, and if that’s what you’re craving, you’re only going one place - Raimondo’s. The portions are all large, and unless you biked to this Ship Bottom spot from Beach Haven or Loveladies, the appetizers, like meatballs with whipped ricotta or octopus with fregola sarda pasta, could work as entrees. There’s also a veal porterhouse with mushroom confit and deep-fried asparagus that’s served over linguini alfredo, and it’s one of our favorites dishes on the island.",/philadelphia/reviews/raimondos-lbi,0.8972619030970395,820
"Mud City is from the same people as Old Causeway (and places on the island like Parker’s Garage and Ship Bottom Shellfish), and since it’s literally next door, you can use the same private shuttle to get to and from either place. The menu is seafood focused, with things like soft shell crabs, baked clams, and massive crab cakes that are almost entirely made up of crab meat. For those who like to drink, they have a full bar in a converted trailer on the outdoor patio, and for those who like to drink a lot, they fully allow BYOB.",/philadelphia/reviews/mud-city-crab-house-lbi,0.8642483178738424,164
"Kubel’s feels like a locals-only spot. It’s a loud, dark bar that opened in 1927 near the docks in Barnegat Light with free popcorn, a few domestic beers, and a simple menu of things like clam strips and house chili. But it’s tough for any spot on the island to keep from being somewhat overrun during the summer anymore, and it’s pretty much impossible after Anthony Bourdain films a TV show there. Even still, Kubel’s is relatively low-key, and it’s a place everyone should check out at least once. Come during Happy Hour (4-7pm on weekdays), get some discounted beers and bar food while watching early season baseball on TV, and you’ll feel like you’re part of the locals-only crowd.",/philadelphia/reviews/kubels-lbi,0.891085735064531,1126
"You want to bring sandwiches to the beach, but you don’t want to spend all morning trying to remember who throws tantrums when you leave the crust on their bread. Instead, just make a pitstop at Pearl Street Market, a Beach Haven spot that has some of the best deli and seafood sandwiches on the island. You can go with a Greek chicken wrap or lobster roll, which is light on mayo and very heavy on lobster. Or if you want to get something that’ll keep you from eating a whole box of Cheez-Its at 3pm, try the roast beef melt or baseball-sized crab cake on brioche. There are also a bunch of tables out front in case you don’t want to deal with seagulls and runaway napkins while you eat.",/philadelphia/reviews/pearl-street-market-lbi,0.869795670342639,254
"From the lighthouse and state park to the massive mini-golf course that’d give Happy Gilmore fits (with or without Chubbs), there are a lot of reasons you might find yourself in Barnegat Light. So you should know about Daymark, a year-round American spot from the people behind The Arlington that works for all kinds of dining situations. Come during brunch and get the fried oysters with syrupy grits or the breakfast burger (a pork roll, egg, and cheese on top of a patty), during Happy Hour (4-7pm every day) at the big, rectangular bar, or for dinner when there’s usually live music.",/philadelphia/reviews/daymark-bar-restaurant-lbi,0.8932806282186494,1303
"The Arlington is pretty upscale by LBI standards. But it’s also on LBI, which is why we never feel out of place walking straight here for lunch or $1 oyster Happy Hour after spending too many hours riding two-foot chop in 60-degree water. Fortunately, it’s a short walk, as this big American spot, which actually looks more like a ski lodge than an island restaurant, is less than a block from the beach in Ship Bottom. Whether you sit in the first-come bar area or get a table in one of the dining rooms, you should start with a plate of chicken wings with housemade ranch and any of the 22 unusual, rotating beers they have on tap.

"Think about all the foods you associate with LBI, and besides breakfast dishes and a bag of sand-covered potato chips, you can find all of them at Barry’s. This counter-service spot just south of Bay Village in Beach Haven serves burgers, Italian hoagies, meatball parms, and really good cheesesteaks - and those are only four of the 20 different sections on the menu. You really can’t go wrong as long as you remember two key things: get the garlic rolls - a dozen doughy balls that you dip in marinara sauce - and finish up at the ice cream bar. There are a ton of different toppings you can choose for either soft serve or a scoop of ice cream, as well as a whole menu of sundaes and milkshakes.",/philadelphia/reviews/barrys-do-me-a-flavor-lbi,0.8725455806452631,883
"When you want a 30-minute throwback to a simpler time, back when people tucked short-sleeved button-downs into khakis, go to Holiday Snack Bar. It’s been serving a short menu focused on griddle-cooked burgers and housemade pies since 1948, and the circular bar is still a good spot to pull up a seat, drink a milkshake, and temporarily forget about the sparkling Jordans and matcha ice cream back home.",/philadelphia/reviews/holiday-snack-bar-lbi,0.8984960957212206,656
"There are some things New Jersey does as well as anywhere in the country: be the set of HBO shows, house the stadiums of other states’ sports teams, and serve great Italian food. Combine that (just the bit about the Italian food) with the fact that LBI has great seafood, and you get some of the best food on the island at Stefano’s. This upscale spot in Beach Haven does straightforward Italian dishes really well, like eggplant parm and housemade meatballs, as well as some seafood, like crab-encrusted salmon over lobster mashed potatoes. But our favorite things here are the combinations, like local scallops over crab and tomato risotto, and penne vodka with shrimp, scallops, and lots of crab meat.

Check out Yellowfin, a small, BYOB seafood spot in Surf City with candlelit tables and white tablecloths.

This BYOB American spot on Long Beach Boulevard in Beach Haven serves things like yellowfin tuna and lobster-whipped potatoes at dinner, but it also has a massive all-day menu with things like huevos rancheros and Nutella french toast.

You definitely don’t want to wait 90 minutes for a table at the Chegg (Chicken Or The Egg), so walk a block over to Uncle Will’s. This diner in the middle of Beach Haven has been around since 1965 and has a lot of space and tables that work for big groups. Most dishes come with home fries, but for $1.50 you can substitute them for a full stack of blueberry or banana chocolate chip pancakes, which you should absolutely do.

Regardless, you don’t feel like going out for dinner tonight. Instead, bring in some pizzas from Panzone’s, which has locations in Beach Haven and Surf City.

But just know that you’re going to feel a bit underdressed at The Gables. From the long, dripping candles on the white tablecloth tables, to the chandeliers and old paintings, to the piano player in the entrance hall, this 19th-century inn in Beach Haven is the most formal restaurant on the island. The space is beautiful, including an outdoor terrace that feels like it belongs in Charleston, and the food - like rich Thai curry soup with shrimp, a giant ravioli with ricotta and crispy bacon, and seared scallops over mushroom risotto - is excellent, both of which make it a good place to celebrate a special occasion.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-gables-lbi,0.8893004793791625,927

But one place that’s worth traveling for is Skipper Dipper in Beach Haven. It’s been around since the ’70s, serving tons of flavors in hard and soft serve, sundaes, and milkshakes, including a cold brew float with coffee from La Colombe.

Go to The Local, a casual market right by the foot of the bridge in Ship Bottom, where you can sit outside and read the paper while drinking coffee and eating a pork roll, egg, and cheese. They also serve really good sandwiches until 7pm every day, so pick up a triple-decker turkey and swiss or a roast beef with horseradish cheddar on your way to the beach or as a snack for the road on your way off the island.",/philadelphia/reviews/local-market-kitchen-lbi,0.8756485289559726,1345

It’s a casual spot with a big menu that ranges from buffalo calamari to shrimp stuffed with crab imperial, but we like to keep it simple and dip bread into a big bowl of clams with wine and garlic butter.

The outside of this big spot in Harvey Cedars looks like a nice home, as does the inside, with a carpeted dining room that has a fireplace, and another room with green wallpaper and random picture frames. It’s a comfortable spot for lunch or brunch when you can sit at a table and get a massive bacon cheeseburger or sweet potato hash with corned beef and eggs, but it’s best during Happy Hour from 4-7pm every day.

Like Boulevard Clams and Pinky’s Shrimps, it has a staff who would bankrupt ABC if Jeopardy only asked questions about the ocean, and they serve seafood that you can literally watch come in off the docks in Viking Village.

"Chloe’s Corner is a small ice cream shack that looks like it would be in a ’90s family sitcom. It’s seasonal, so it’s only open when the weather is nice out, but you’re probably not trying to go to an outdoor ice cream shack when it’s snowing out anyway. The menu is pretty straightforward, with everything from ice cream bars to scoops on a cone, but our personal favorite is the classic ice cream sundae.",/philadelphia/reviews/chloes-corner,0.8680864257596479,1359
"Drury Beer Garden is hidden behind the Greek restaurant Opa in Midtown Village. It’s a courtyard with a bunch of mismatched tables and an old wooden bar that we’re pretty sure someone on the staff handmade back in 1995, and you’ll find good drinks, some great spanakopita to chase them with, and occasionally even live music.",/philadelphia/reviews/drury-beer-garden,0.8949273451830284,662
"There are a lot of museums in Philly, from ones that house really old art to ones that house really old jars containing medically-interesting body parts, but the Penn Museum is the nicest one to hang out at in the summertime. In addition to the galleries full of statues and other artifacts, there’s a garden out front with a reflecting pool and some umbrella-covered tables that you can bring your own lunch to from Han Dynasty down the street.",/philadelphia/reviews/penn-museum,0.8352307651646195,338
"Tequila’s has been around for so long that sometimes people forget how great it is. And while it’s one of the best date night places in the area all year long, it’s especially useful in the summer, when they set up a bunch of tables on the sidewalk and quietly celebrate SIPS with $6 margaritas and half-priced appetizers. Because it’s located off the main Rittenhouse stretch, it feels like a little bit of a secret, which will make you seem more impressive to your friends when you can easily grab an outdoor table there while people down the street are waiting in lines just to get into Paganos.",/philadelphia/reviews/tequilas,0.884014442078854,854
"The beer garden at UCity Square is a vacant lot for most of the year, but during the summer, the Philadelphia Horticultural Society turns it into a full-on forest with big trees, wood-chip floors, and string lights. Even if you don’t normally hang out in West Philly, it’s worth taking a trip here to drink some craft beers in this Narnia-esque garden.",/philadelphia/reviews/phs-pop-up-garden-at-ucity-square,0.8721868356473792,536
"Spruce Street Harbor Park is one of the nicest-looking beer gardens in Philly. It’s covered in grass with hammocks and Adirondack chairs scattered around, there are trees for shade (very important when August rolls around), and it has a floating beer garden barge for when you don’t have anything productive to do later that night.",/philadelphia/reviews/spruce-street-harbor-park,0.8704530384258644,752
"The best way to deal with those days when you might get sun poisoning just by looking at the reflection off the sidewalk is to leave the city altogether. But when the shore is too far and the suburbs are too boring, spend the day eating and drinking at Manayunk Brewing Co. It has a huge outdoor patio that’s right next to the river, and it’s so peaceful you might even start to understand why anyone decides to live in Amish country.",/philadelphia/reviews/manayunk-brewery-restaurant,0.9093135633463615,1157
"You’ll have to bring your own food and drinks to Urban Axes in Kensington, but it’s worth it to learn how to (safely) throw sharp objects at a bullseye with all your closest friends. You likely won’t be confused for Arya Stark by the end of your session, but you’ll probably be just as confident in your skills anyways.",/philadelphia/reviews/urban-axes,0.8533782177397339,377
"Effie’s is a Greek BYOB in Washington Square West that only has about 15 seats inside. And while the food is good enough to warrant dropping by for some spanakopita at one of those few tables, it’s even better when their back garden is open - pretty much doubling its space on a nice night. Taken together, the food, space, and relaxed atmosphere make Effie’s a place worth knowing about and, much like your juvenile records or Halle Berry’s real age, it’s a secret you should probably keep to yourself.",/philadelphia/reviews/effies-restaurant,0.8853043124134128,210
"Sunset Social is a bar on top of a parking garage in University City, and it has pretty much everything you could possibly want from a rooftop. Frozen cocktails? Check. Views of Center City and the Schuylkill? Yup. Astroturf that makes you feel like you’re in a field instead of literally on top of a parking garage? You bet. They also have some other great stuff, like a huge TV screen for mid-summer movie-watching and a short menu with things like burgers and fries - basically everything you could need for a few hours of drinking when it’s still light out.",/philadelphia/reviews/sunset-social,0.8521574862924535,725
"SIPS is fun, sure, but it’s also an excuse for groups of friends to get really drunk on $3 beers in swarms that seem to somehow double in size every time they move to a new bar. If that’s not exactly your speed, head to Balcony Bar. It’s a rooftop that’s only open to the public on Wednesday nights during the summer, and of all the places that participate in SIPS, this one always stays pretty calm. Plus, they serve food from the people behind Amada, so you know you’re going to eat better than you would at most of the other bars in Center City.",/philadelphia/reviews/balcony-bar-pop-up,0.889489483653489,466
"Morgan’s Pier has everything you could possibly want in a beer garden: river views, a ton of seating, and over 40 different beers to choose from. So, not surprisingly, it’s pretty much the biggest day drinking party in the city during the summer. Even with the huge amount of space it takes up under the Ben Franklin Bridge, Morgan’s Pier still gets crowded super quickly, so your best bet is to head here early, grab a few tables, and order enough pitchers so that you don’t have to get the bartender’s attention for the foreseeable future.",/philadelphia/reviews/morgans-pier,0.8800056798271514,605
"Stratus is the rooftop bar at Hotel Monaco in Old City and it’s probably the highest up place you can be in the area without taking a helicopter tour or building a drone big enough to sit on. It’s a pretty classic hotel rooftop lounge, with lots of low white couches and a few overpriced cocktails, but it has one of the best views of the city, which makes it worth bringing any out-of-town visitors to after a long day of staring at old buildings.",/philadelphia/reviews/stratus-rooftop-lounge,0.8818430152039093,1323
"The Moshulu is a super old boat that’s somehow still floating in the Delaware, and while the dining room inside is somewhat of a tourist trap, during the summer the huge deck on top turns into a bar with cocktails and small bites. Make it a point to come at least once before it closes for the winter, and get here early enough to take over one of the loungers before it gets too crowded.",/philadelphia/reviews/moshulu,0.869463391136041,1324
"Sure, you could go to Silk City during the day and have a nice brunch in their outdoor garden space. Or you could show up a few drinks deep at midnight and head straight up to “The Lounge,” where they have a bar, some tables, guest DJs, and a dance floor that’s always full. Afterwards, you can head to Wawa with half the city, stand in line at the deli counter behind someone who’s staring at the “Need more time to finish your order?” screen like a zombie, and then finally make it home to eat your meatball sub in peace. Definitely go back to Silk City the next morning for some pancakes, though, as long as the sight of it doesn’t make you feel too nauseous.",/philadelphia/reviews/silk-city-diner-bar-lounge,0.8777359358773796,569
"Yakitori boy is a karaoke spot disguised as a restaurant, and it’s somewhere that you can both start and end your night. They have full dinner service downstairs, with things like ramen, sushi, and yakitori skewers. And upstairs, there are big karaoke rooms that can hold up to 20 of your closest friends for sake bomb-fueled renditions of “Lose Yourself” and anything Shania Twain.",/philadelphia/reviews/yakitori-boy,0.8802585013992504,308
"There are good things and not-so-great things about Howl At The Moon. On the plus side, it’s a dueling pianos bar, so the music is pretty much all sing-alongs, and they serve very affordable drinks. However, the space is small and it gets so crowded on the weekends that there’s usually a line halfway down the block once it hits capacity. So you should show up early, but if you come with a bunch of low-maintenance people who just want to drink a few beers and join in with the entire bar in at least one rendition of “Piano Man,” Howl At The Moon is here for you.",/philadelphia/reviews/howl-at-the-moon,0.8150200594986488,367
"Concourse has a full-room ball pit. We think that’s the most important piece of information about this place, and everything else comes second. It kind of seems like it would be your average Center City nightclub, but Concourse blasts Backstreet Boys instead of standard house music and has a bunch of local beers on tap, making it a good time even if you usually avoid clubs like the plague. Just make sure there are a few drinks involved before you enter the ball pit, or you’ll start thinking about everyone who was in there before you, which is never a place your mind should go.",/philadelphia/reviews/concourse-dance-club,0.8823792180334267,158
"We’re not sure exactly who gave the OK on the name “The Plough And The Stars,” but regardless, if you’re in need of a bar in Old City where you can complain about drink prices until you’re three vodka sodas in and finally realize that each of those drinks would be considered a double at any other bar in the city, this is it. It’s usually crowded, and you’ll probably have to deal with getting stepped on or pushed at least a few times throughout the night, but after a few drinks, you won’t even care that your toe is throbbing and there’s a splash of cranberry juice on your shirt. There’s also a narrow upstairs balcony where you can dance, if you’re really feeling the Justin Timberlake remixes.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-plough-and-the-stars,0.9041241628942648,122
"Yes, Voyeur is a club. Like, a serious club. And in no world should you ever start your night here. But when it’s 1:15am, you’re a few Citywides deep, and need to move your body around to a DJ whose name is something like Brockstar, Voyeur is where you want to go. The crowd here can be a little intense, and you’ll certainly see at least a few people wearing tight sparkly dresses and six-inch clear plastic heels, but you’ll also see a bunch of grad students in sneakers and t-shirts doing the same thing you are. And that is jumping around to remixed ’80s hits until you get kicked out and roll across the street to fill your arms with every bag of chips Wawa carries.",/philadelphia/reviews/voyeur,0.8788167246364016,863
"Having an “OUT out” night once you’re past the age of 25 is kind of like your dad trying to keep up in the family’s once-a-year tag football game at Thanksgiving: you can play just as well as everyone else for a little while, but you’re going to need to sit out a few plays. Franky Bradley’s is a two-floor bar in Midtown Village that looks like an average dive when you walk in, but has a full dance floor complete with a disco ball on the second floor. It’s perfect for when you want to dance like you just turned old enough to vote, but still have the option to take a few much-needed breathers on the first floor to complain about your bad knee to the bartender.",/philadelphia/reviews/franky-bradleys,0.8466954871325334,1156
"Other than being kind of a tongue twister, Fiore Fine Foods is an all-day Italian spot in Queen Village that does everything from morning pastries to brick-oven pizzas for lunch and swiss chard tortelli at night. It’s the kind of place - sort of like Hungry Pigeon - that you could show up to three times in the same day for three totally different experiences. You could stop by in the morning for a coffee and a cinnamon bun on your way to work, come back for a long lunch of wine and pizza with a friend, and then return yet again with a group for some more wine and pasta. At the end of the day, you probably wouldn’t even be sick of it, but you should take a few days off anyways - don’t want to scare their employees.",/philadelphia/reviews/fiore-fine-foods,0.8561221998375079,569
"Garage has locations in both Fishtown and East Passyunk, and both are large, relatively empty spaces with garage doors that are thrown up as soon as the temperature hits 60 - making it a great place to day drink during the summer. It has one of the biggest selections of canned beer in the city, which means you’ll generally find people combing through the 40+ page menu with a look of sheer terror in their eyes, trying to make a decision between 100 different IPAs.",/philadelphia/reviews/garage-1,0.8532904424347387,846
"Going to a sports bar usually means loud, rowdy crowds of people who are certain the players can hear them through the TV as long as they yell loud enough. Founding Fathers in Grad Hospital, though, is a much quieter, more upscale version of a sports bar that’s good for when you’re watching the game with your in-laws or clients. They also have some solid bar food that’s a little fancier than what you’d normally see - things like blackened ahi tuna tacos and Korean fried wings.",/philadelphia/reviews/founding-fathers-sports-bar-grill,0.8425996708895749,682
"Stats on 17th is one of the newer sports bars in the area, and we kind of have a love-hate relationship with it. We love it because the space is huge and there’s about a one-to-one ratio of huge leather sectionals to projector screens. So if you can commandeer a couch with a bunch of friends, you can basically make this place your own personal living room. Just maybe avoid it on weekend nights, when they bring a DJ out and it turns into more of a club scene with strobes and the occasional appearance of a fog machine.

"Chinatown doesn’t have too many sports bars, but it doesn’t really need a ton because it has Bar Ly, and Bar Ly is awesome. There’s nothing different or unusual about this sort of bland-looking bar in between a bunch of dim sum and hot pot restaurants, but the bartenders are friendly, it’s never super crowded, and, most importantly, there’s always a full table available for the taking. That makes it kind of a magical third dimension in Philly, where it’s almost impossible to get a seat at any bar during an Eagles game unless you show up four hours early and aggressively guard a table. Plus, it’s about a block from Dim Sum Garden, which is exactly what you’ll want after a bunch of anxiety-induced Bud Lights.",/philadelphia/reviews/bar-ly-chinatown,0.8124989350996482,210
"If you want to watch the Eagles or the Sixers or even the Philadelphia Soul, you can pretty much walk into any bar with a working TV and find them on it. But if you’re a soccer fan, your choices are a lot more limited. There are, however, a few places around the city that play the matches - and the best of them is Fado. Unlike most other soccer bars, Fado doesn’t play favorites on which matches they show, and they’re usually showing multiple at a time. You can also download their entire viewing schedule on their website so you don’t have to wonder what you’re about to walk into.",/philadelphia/reviews/fado-irish-pub,0.8223047898724334,71

The flatbreads are perfect for sharing and are topped with everything from labneh and za’atar to lamb lahm bajeen. And no matter what you do, you shouldn’t leave without scanning the bakery cases.

Before heading back to your responsibility-filled adult life, thank your sister and her roommate for hosting you by bringing them to Renata’s Kitchen for brunch.

"Franklin’s Table probably came into existence as kind of a quasi-cafeteria for college students, but it’s turned into an outpost for some of the best restaurants in Philly to serve more casual stuff that can be picked up in between classes or on your way home from the gym. Kensington Quarter’s spot in the hall is called KQ, and it serves a short menu of mostly sandwiches (plus fries and pickled vegetables). The only thing you really need to focus on here, though, is the classic burger, which comes topped with cheddar, KQ sauce, and roasted red onions, and is one of the best burgers in the city.",/philadelphia/reviews/kq-burger,0.873279890750493,1373
"Dock Street Brewing Co. is located in an old firehouse right around University City, and it has some of the best personal pies in the area, as well as a pretty big bar food menu and a rotating tap list.

"Flambo sounds like a really bad remake of Rambo that maybe stars Guy Fieri, but it’s actually a really solid Caribbean restaurant in Fairmount where you can get a huge dinner for about $20.

"The best part about Ocean Prime is how accessible it is. You almost never have to make a reservation here, so if you’ve had a particularly bad day at work that will only be made better by consuming an entire steak by yourself, you should just grab a seat at the Ocean Prime bar. In addition to being one of the best looking bars in the area, it also has one of the better cocktail menus - with things like a whiskey clover with honey water and rum punch with chocolate bitters.",/philadelphia/reviews/ocean-prime,0.8587745567463219,1272

It almost feels like you’re on the Titanic back in 1914, in that big dining room where Jack sees Rose walking down the staircase. While you spend the next 40 minutes arguing over whether Jack could have fit on the door (which he objectively could have), get at least one order of the Imperial Crab and a few steaks to share.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-prime-rib,0.817682497555477,1224

And as much as that entire building is an eyesore on the Delaware River, sometimes it’s almost ironically fun to go play a bunch of slots and follow it up with a $60 steak and a Manhattan. That’s exactly what Hugo’s exists for - well, that and the outdoor patio overlooking the river. The steaks here are surprisingly good, and they even have a special “Philly cut,” which is a bone-in filet mignon topped with a provolone sauce and fried shallots.

"Like Attico and Bok Bar, Assembly is one of the coolest rooftop spots in Philadelphia. The place has pretty much everything you could want from a venue where you go to drink outside on top of a building—that includes good cocktails like rose gold margaritas, a great view of the the Ben Franklin Parkway, and semi-circle couches that you can throw your belongings across to save seats for friends who may never show up. There’s also an indoor portion of the bar that’s open in the winter (named Alpine Heights) where you can sip a cinnamony hot toddy. And when it’s cold enough, they’ll turn the fire pits outside on full blast so you can pretend the groundhog either did or did not see its shadow—whichever means that winter is almost over. ,When it comes to their menu, like the rooftop’s decorations, it changes seasonally. The dishes can range from light small plates like an arugula salad or charcuterie board to heartier selections like a mound of tender beef stew over polenta and a cheesy tartiflette with more layered potatoes than a Pringles sleeve. ,Whether it’s for an after-work hangout, having a quick drink before heading to Roar, or when you want to spend your night at a beautiful space where you can hide your questionable dance moves, come to Assembly. ,

And in an Applebee’s, Chili’s, or pretty much any other restaurant where they have the entire staff come to your table with a huge gong and sing to you, you would be correct. At Ray’s, though, it’s somehow the opposite. By the time you get to the fifth serenade, you’ll be a few shots in and it will feel like it’s two weeks before Christmas and Mariah Carey’s version of “All I Want For Christmas Is You” just came on over the loudspeaker.

And if you’re not wearing the right shoes or you itch your nose with your left hand instead of your right hand, he may just tell you to step out of line and walk away. It’s made us swear off the whole place more than once. But once you get past him, Hop Sing is one of the coolest and most unique bars in Philadelphia. The walls are covered in velvety red wallpaper and there are candelabras on every table that look like they’re about to jump to life a la Beauty And The Beast.

Their South Philly location is only a short walk away from the sports arenas, and it stays open until 9pm, which means you’ll be able to get a box of cannolis after any mid-day Phillies game, or a 7 o’clock Flyers game that was so depressing the entire stadium left after the second period.",/philadelphia/reviews/termini-bros,0.8811908430000771,849

Plus, you can go for deli sandwiches like their beet reuben, or sugary treats like their chocolate chip cookies or blueberry crumble when you want something more filling.

"Umai Umai is a small sushi spot in Fairmount that could work for anything from a casual weeknight dinner by yourself to a weekend date night. It’s a bit more expensive than your average neighborhood sushi spot, but still affordable, especially considering how fresh and creative the rolls are. The 4-8-15-23-42 is one of our favorites, but any of the rolls or sashimi are good bets.",/philadelphia/reviews/umai-umai,0.7915751322111226,521
"Aksum is a Mediterranean BYOB in West Philly with things like a vegetable tagine served over couscous that’s one of our favorite vegetarian dishes in the city, and an especially large lemon caper chicken dish for when you’re extra hungry. It’s super versatile and affordable, so you can use it for everything from a casual weeknight date to a dinner with your visiting in-laws.",/philadelphia/reviews/aksum,0.8797971233830868,377
"Baology is a fast casual spot in Logan Square that gets super crowded during lunch hours, but is way more enjoyable for a post-work solo dinner. They specialize in Taiwanese bao buns that are excellent across the board, but the best things to get here are the pork and shrimp dumplings with a side of the cold sesame noodles with peanut sauce.",/philadelphia/reviews/baology,0.8176000779383427,880
"A.bar is the companion bar to A.kitchen, and it serves similar food as A.kitchen, but in a less formal space. On any given night, it’s filled with a combination of first dates and people who work in the area stopping by for a quick meal with a couple of coworkers, but we also like it for a solo meal on the weekend after a long day of shopping in Rittenhouse. The menu is pretty solid all around, but the oysters and ricotta tartine are the best things here.",/philadelphia/reviews/abar,0.8654281246336099,905
"Reading Terminal Market is a scary and overwhelming place, with so many stalls and shops that it’s hard to know where to start. So after wasting an hour walking around and waiting in too many lines, make sure to end up at Pearl’s Oyster Bar. It won’t be the place with the longest line or the most people taking pictures, but they have a counter that usually has a seat or two open and some really damn good snapper soup.",/philadelphia/reviews/pearls-oyster-bar,0.854973514455464,867
"Redcrest on East Passyunk only has a couple of tables and a small bar against the wall, but if you’re having a bad week and just need to decompress with some fried chicken, this is the place you want to be. The fried chicken is why you’re here and you can get it a bunch of different ways, like in a sandwich, by itself, or in wing form. They also have a wide range of sides and sauces, so feel free to get creative.",/philadelphia/reviews/redcrest-fried-chicken,0.838744073940806,3
"Hale &amp; True Cider Co. is a big cidery in Queen Village with high ceilings and a rotating selection of seasonal ciders. Their flights come with an optional cheese pairing, which is probably a solid idea for your friend who “hasn’t eaten anything since breakfast,” but continues to pound pints. We like it best as a spot to day drink during the winter, but it’s also a good place to end a date after grabbing dinner across the street at The Good King Tavern.",/philadelphia/reviews/hale-true,0.8905102830793122,642
"Doobie’s Bar is a magical place. At first glance, it looks like any other dive bar in the city, but this cash-only spot in Fitler Square has some sort of weird power that turns any regular night into the kind you’ll be hearing different accounts of for the next month. Maybe it’s because of how perfectly retro it is without trying, or maybe it’s because, like Eric Foreman’s basement in That ’70s Show, it’s the only meeting point that makes sense no matter what kind of night you want to have. Regardless of who you come here with, you’ll either end your night arguing over whether “jilp” is a real word in Scrabble, or standing on a chair loudly singing the words to an AC/DC song from the jukebox.",/philadelphia/reviews/doobies,0.8607785220416186,430
"Marigold Kitchen is located inside a nondescript Victorian townhouse in West Philly, and everything they do here is different. The food is vaguely Nordic (for now), but the best way to describe it is “experimental.” They’re always changing up the tasting menus and putting together gorgeous dishes that mix a ton of seemingly random ingredients, but are all excellent for the most part. And, if nothing else, you’ll have one of the most interesting meals in Philly when you come here.",/philadelphia/reviews/marigold-kitchen,0.8817662226512925,193
"R&amp;D used to be a full restaurant with brunch and dinner service called Root, but then it closed down, brainstormed a bit, and decided to reopen as R&amp;D doing solely what it did best the first time - cocktails (and a few small bar snacks like popcorn and whipped ricotta). It’s much better this way, and the dark space is filled with two-tops, candles, and a lot of velvet - making it one of the better places in the area to end your next date night.",/philadelphia/reviews/rd,0.858653678006586,487
"We’re not sure if naming things by their physical attributes is or ever has been a thing, but we’re into it. From now on, we’re calling dachshunds oblong terriers and referring to beds as soft rectangular prisms. Triangle Tavern, right off East Passyunk in South Philly, also has a name that describes exactly what it is: a triangle-shaped tavern. And in a lot of ways, it’s similar to other bars in the area - it has a long draft list and a low-key feel that makes it a good place to grab a weeknight beer with an old friend. But unlike other taverns in the area, this one has really good bar food, like homemade pasta, polenta fries, and a ton of vegan options if meat isn’t your thing.",/philadelphia/reviews/triangle-tavern,0.8848813011545889,758
"Everything about The Library Bar in The Rittenhouse Hotel screams winter, but in a good way, like one of those lavish castles from a Christmas movie that’s set in a non-existent, vaguely European-sounding country. There’s a fireplace, a bunch of books that we’re assuming haven’t been read in a very long time, and, most importantly, strong drinks to keep you warm. Their drinks and bar snacks change throughout the year, so even if it’s not fireplace season, it’s still worth a trip for a creative cocktail - as long as you’re cool with spending $18 on a drink.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-library-at-rittenhouse,0.8780560896989333,1378
"There are a lot of places with fireplaces in Philly, but Devil’s Den, a beer bar in East Passyunk with some good bar food, has a double-sided fireplace that’s lit all winter long - meaning that no matter where you’re sitting, you’ll always have a view and some warmth. They also do a fire lighting ceremony at the beginning of each winter, and even when the summer hits and their fireplace is shut down, they still have $4 drafts that are well worth the visit.",/philadelphia/reviews/devils-den,0.8982383469814117,454
"Ceviche and potatoes: two of the best foods on this planet, and two things that Vista Peru, a loungey Peruvian restaurant in Old City, does very well. We especially like their ceviche de camarones, which has shrimp, red onion, sweet potatoes, and corn all tossed together and marinated in a super light, citrusy sauce. Another thing they do well? Pisco sours. They have a huge pisco bar up front with a ton of different varieties, as well as about 10 pisco cocktails to try.",/philadelphia/reviews/vista-peru,0.8554676584967366,111
"Spring Garden’s SOUTH is part Southern restaurant and part jazz club with two memorable seating options: an open atrium and outdoor garden space. And between the live music, cocktails, and the outdoor space, it’s one of the most romantic spots in the neighborhood. If you want to impress your date with something other than the saxophone solos coming from the stage, make sure to order the shrimp and grits. The grits are creamy and buttery and get drenched in a peppery creole brown sauce. But the entire dish is about the size of a softball so you might need to order a bowl of their shredded chicken and turkey gumbo to fill out the meal.",/philadelphia/reviews/south-restaurant,0.8740313860407289,1005
"Besides being one of the oldest bars in Philly, McGillin’s is also the entire city’s favorite place to day drink and watch sports. The beer hall has rows of long picnic tables, projector screens playing whatever game is currently on TV, and no matter what time of year it is, you’ll see big groups cheers-ing each other with pints of whatever’s on draft. They also have two fireplaces, so it’s especially relevant in the winter, when all of the outdoor beer gardens are closed and day drinking options have dwindled.",/philadelphia/reviews/mcgillins-olde-ale-house,0.8136173918347824,1224
"Little Nonna’s is deceptive. From the outside, you would think you’re just passing by a bakery or small cafe. But this is just a front for what’s happening in the back - a big garden space with string lights hung up on the trellis that covers the whole patio. For a date in Midtown Village, you can’t do much better. The menu is full of classic Italian things, but the Sunday gravy is why you should come here. You'll get a plate full of braised short ribs and fennel sausage covered in marinara, and they sometimes run out of it before the night is over, so you want to make a reservation here on the earlier side.",/philadelphia/reviews/little-nonnas,0.8854349815531211,363
"Most bakeries have a specialty. Whether it’s bread, bagels, pastries or desserts, there’s usually something you can point to as what they’re “known for” or what they do best. But Vanilya specializes in everything Their bagels are some of the best in the city, they make pastries like almond croissants that we would eat every day for breakfast, and their goat cheese cheesecake is creamy but light and we may or may not have already ordered one for each of our next five birthdays.",/philadelphia/reviews/vanilya-bakery,0.8350345542187827,1045
"If you’re in Fishtown and need a casual and generally pretty quiet cafe to get some work done or grab a quick coffee, Steap &amp; Grind is a solid choice. They have a good lunch menu with salads and sandwiches that will do the trick when you’re in the area and their daily iced tea flavors, like grapefruit and blood orange, are a good alternative to the liter of iced green tea you usually mobile order from Starbucks.",/philadelphia/reviews/steap-and-grind,0.8255783778677566,405
"If you’ve ever seen Mad Men and wished your work life was all drinking and smoking cigarettes and having “creative meetings” that are really just more drinking, you should be hanging out at Bud &amp; Marilyn’s. It’s perfectly retro, with wood-paneled walls and black-and-white dial TVs, and you can eat all of the buttery comfort food you want - like crispy cheese curds and fried chicken - without any of the obvious cons of living in the 1960’s. Plus, their weekend brunch includes some of the best breakfast cocktails we’ve found in Center City, and the caramelized apple french toast is exactly what your Sunday needs to distract you from the impending work week.",/philadelphia/reviews/bud-marilyns,0.9003131072849114,9
"You’ll probably encounter a few tourists when you go to Ralph’s, but that’s kind of fair seeing as it’s one of the oldest Italian restaurants in the country (it opened its doors in 1900). You really feel like you’re stepping back in time, from the little tables all crammed together to the black and white photos hanging on the green tile and floral wallpapered walls, and the food is the sam way. Expect big portions of everything from spaghetti to shrimp scampi that you probably won’t be able to finish. On the plus side, you’ll have lunch for the next week.",/philadelphia/reviews/ralphs-italian-restaurant,0.8852095025562627,842
"Giuseppe &amp; Sons is a collaboration between Termini Brothers, one of the oldest bakeries in the city, and the people behind places like Double Knot and Osteria, and it’s kind of like when Netflix revamps an old show from the 80’s with their big studio budget. It’s two floors, with the top as more of a casual lunch spot serving Italian sandwiches and pastries from Termini Bros. The bottom floor, on the other hand, is designed for dinner and is a huge space that looks like the cave where James Bond gets all his weapons. It’s supposed to be a take on a classic South Philly Italian spot, but is basically nothing like any place we’ve ever been to in South Philly, minus the vintage black and white photos hung on the walls. They serve all the classics, from meatballs &amp; gravy to a clam linguini, and all of it is fine, but it won’t convince you to substitute this in for your monthly Ralph’s or Mr. Martinos Trattoria visit.",/philadelphia/reviews/giuseppe-sons,0.8474393392694428,1257
"Buk Chon is a quiet Korean spot in Old City that serves a variety of classic dishes, from Korean fried chicken to bibimbap and budae stew, and it’s all delicious and pretty cheap. You can get a full dinner for about $25 per person, and it’s also a BYOB with no corkage fee, so you won’t spend any extra money on mark ups. The space is small, with a long open kitchen up front that empties into a room with high-ceilings and about six tables, and you can definitely hear everyone else’s conversations around you, but how else would you keep up with what Cardi B wore to every award show in the past year?",/philadelphia/reviews/buk-chon-korean-cuisine,0.8900837360935671,512
"Vernick Coffee Bar in the Comcast Tech Center is one of the coolest places to grab a croissant and coffee in the city. The space is surrounded by massive indoor trees, along with a white dome that looks like a spaceship ride at Universal Studios—looking up at a ceiling with glowing words streaming across it is great for productivity after all. There is tons of open space, and  you can choose from a menu of caffè umbria coffee (which you can surprisingly get a large for under $5). They also have in-house baked goods like strawberry and passion fruit kouign amann, grain bowls, sandwiches, and light options like their chilled soba and sesame that’s topped with cilantro and has a citrusy sauce on it. Unlike most coffee shops, they take reservations here so you can calmly come in with your laptop and bag without having to plot on a working space while you’re in line.

"There are a lot of old-school Italian BYOBs in Philadelphia that are filled with tourists, but this one isn’t. It’s a little more under the radar, and it has a lot more South Philly left in it than most other places in the city. There are pictures of customers and their families hung up on the walls, and if you go on a weeknight, most of the people there seem like they’ve been eating pasta here since it opened in the ’60s. The menu is long and has all of the things you’d expect from an Italian spot, including what feels like an unlimited amount of pasta combinations, and it’s the kind of place you’ll want to keep to yourself and tell everyone in the world about at the same time.",/philadelphia/reviews/villa-di-roma,0.8541883375943302,12
"If you’ve ever wondered what makes Philly cheesesteaks so good, a lot of it is due to the Sarcone’s rolls that the best ones are made with. The Italian Market bakery makes over 25 types of bread every day, and you can order it ahead of time and pick it up in the store if you’re worried they might sell out. They also make square pizzas that are worth the trip alone, and you should always finish with a cannoli - they use the same recipe that they did when they opened in 1918.",/philadelphia/reviews/sarcones-bakery,0.8615526067770793,883
"Koukouzeli is a casual Greek spot in the Italian Market, and it’s open for both lunch and dinner. We like it more for lunch, where you can stop by and grab a gyro pita for $9 that’s better than whatever you get from your favorite street cart. They also have a bunch of mezze dishes like dolmades and kolokithia, and in case it matters to you, there are plenty of vegan options too.",/philadelphia/reviews/koukouzeli,0.8401914285364369,804
"Zavino is one of those places that always gets brought up in conversation when you’re trying to decide where to go for a casual weeknight dinner or date night when you don’t want to spend a ton of money. And probably around 50% of the time, you decide to go there. Partly because it’s an easy choice and you know you’ll have reliably good food, and partly because, even though there’s nothing particularly spectacular about it, you always have a good time here. They also have $8 pizzas during Happy Hour, so that should probably tip the scales towards Zavino in pretty much any instance when you’re trying to eat dinner before 6:30pm.",/philadelphia/reviews/zavino-wine-bar-pizzeria,0.8493207633748237,377
"Birra is a small, casual Italian place with a pretty big selection of beers on tap and a ton of TVs that are usually playing sports. They have things like pasta and calamari, but your best bet here is the pizza. You can get a whole pie for $8 any time, but if you come during Happy Hour (which goes until 6pm on weeknights), you can get an entire cheese pizza for just $4, which is maybe the most ridiculous food deal in the city.",/philadelphia/reviews/birra,0.8526128518237875,736
"There are a lot of BYOB places in East Passyunk, but Brigantessa isn’t one of them. It’s a casual Italian spot where you can get a good pizza and a glass of wine when you don’t have a bottle at home to bring with you (and don’t feel like making the trek to buy one). They also have a Happy Hour where you can get a pizza for $10 and drinks for $5, meaning that if you stop by before 7pm on weeknights, you’ll likely be able to get your entire dinner for around $20.",/philadelphia/reviews/brigantessa-1,0.8778718330339037,71
"Before we tell you anything else about Taproom on 19th, we should tell you that they have a $2 burger during Happy Hour, which makes about as much sense as dudes who wear shorts in 20-degree weather just to prove their masculinity. But in the case of the burger, we’re happy about it. Despite being pretty nondescript and looking like every other sports bar in the city, Taproom on 19th has burgers and wings that are far superior to anywhere else around, and you can get them for super cheap on weeknights before 7pm. So you should get in by 6:55pm, order your $2 burger, and wait for whatever game is probably coming on at 7pm.",/philadelphia/reviews/taproom-on-19th,0.8940284283599998,829
"Wine bars in nice hotels tend to be a little stuffy, and Panorama inside the Penn's View Hotel definitely follows suit. The space is huge, and it looks like the inside of a Main Line mansion, but the food is actually really good - especially the pasta. And while it doesn’t exactly scream “cheap weeknight dinner,” their Happy Hour actually makes it one. All of their appetizers are half off until 7pm every day, and if you get four or five of them, you can easily have a meal here for about $20. Also, their wine tastings are all $5 off, in case the thought of cheese without wine gives you a panic attack.",/philadelphia/reviews/panorama,0.8478415062808,324
"Clarkville is a colorful neighborhood pizza spot in West Philly that’s good for a casual lunch or dinner. Everything on the menu is $15 or less, and if you come during Happy Hour (which goes until 7pm on weeknights), you can get a whole pizza for $7. Or if you’re under 12 (or, more likely, babysitting someone that’s under 12), they’ll give you a pizza and a milk carton for $6.",/philadelphia/reviews/clarkville,0.8247686714464552,1230
"Cozara is a huge izakaya near Penn and Drexel, and they’re open for both lunch and dinner during the week. They have a pretty extensive menu that covers everything from yakitori skewers and ramen bowls to sushi rolls, and it’s all pretty good.

"Bottle Bar East has one of the biggest beer and wine selections in the city, and it’s all in bottles and cans in a stretch of fridges. So instead of standing in front of an annoyed bartender while you flip through 40 pages of options trying to decide which IPA has the lowest price and highest alcohol content, you can stare indecisively at the fridges for as long as you want and they won’t kick you out for wasting their time. Also, if you need a halftime break from your decision-making, they have a ton of seating in the back and upstairs where they serve bar food that’s good all the time, but even better during Happy Hour when appetizers are half-off.",/philadelphia/reviews/bottle-bar-east,0.8903543429217107,1354
"Evil Genius has some of the weirdest-named beers you’ll ever have, and while they’re served in tons of bars around the city, the best place to consume them is at their big brewery in Fishtown. Their selection is always changing, but whether you’re drinking a “The Floor Is Lava” or a “Dorothy In The Streets, Blanche In The Streets,” you’ll be impressed. Just keep in mind that almost all of their beers have super high ABVs, so even if you can normally drink six beers and still be a functioning adult, you should probably dial it down a bit here.",/philadelphia/reviews/evil-genius-beer-company,0.8394199817226791,924
"If you’re into beer, you’ve probably been to Monk’s before. People come to Philadelphia from all over the country to drink beer here and, while that seems a bit dramatic to us, they do have a pretty great selection of rotating taps and over 200 bottled beers at any time. Plus, their Belgian-leaning menu is exactly what you want after a few IPAs and we’re particularly big fans of the duck salad sandwich and mussels.",/philadelphia/reviews/monks-cafe,0.8685457122137397,536
"Located in an old hardware store in South Philly, Mr. Martino’s Trattoria is exactly the kind of old-school Italian BYOB that tourists expect to see as soon as they step out of 30th Street Station. And it checks all the boxes: homemade pastas cooked in a one-woman kitchen, furniture and decor that were probably there when they moved in, and a staff that acts like you’re part of their obscenely large family (for better or worse). The one problem is that it’s only open on weekends, so you have to either get there early or call on a day that they happen to be picking up the phone for a reservation.",/philadelphia/reviews/mr-martinos-trattoria,0.8952616053655419,12
"La Scala’s was probably an upscale place at some point, but now it’s more of an Italian diner, with mirrored walls and TV’s that are usually playing whatever game is on. Their menu is pretty much what you would expect from a classic Italian place, and your best bet is sticking with the pizzas and pastas, which are all delightfully great. Use LaScala’s when you’re in the area and need a spot for a weeknight dinner, or when you’re wandering around Old City on a Sunday night looking for a place to watch the Eagles.",/philadelphia/reviews/lascalas-1,0.8398623684961765,258

It’s every weeknight until 7pm and includes specials like $3 beers, $4 fried ravioli, and $6 Manhattans. You can also go for a full dinner, and while it’s not the most amazing Italian food you’ll ever have, it’s cheap, the pasta is good, and it’s all served in a cavern-like space that kind of reminds us of the Pirates of The Caribbean ride at Disney World.",/philadelphia/reviews/spasso-italian-grill-1,0.8431455416359837,834
"There are a lot of neighborhood sushi spots around the city, but none of them receive as much hype as Kisso. It’s in a little orange room on a corner in Old City, and the menu is straightforward, but everything on it is very, very good. Which would explain why, on a random Tuesday night, you’ll sometimes encounter a 30-minute wait. If you decide to stick it out, they serve some of the freshest fish around and they have some interesting appetizers as well - like the music box (warm king crab in a soy bean wrap topped with creamy soy sauce), and a red snapper carpaccio that we still can’t stop thinking about.",/philadelphia/reviews/kisso-sushi-bar,0.8864895755706322,233
"Sassafras is a little, romantic bar in Old City that has good bar food and even better drinks. It looks kind of like the living room of an old, expensive house that’s also definitely haunted, and the lighting is always dim, with candles on all six of the tables.

The one by the Art Museum also has some outdoor seating when it’s nice out, and it’s usually filled with a mix of families with younger kids and groups of friends grabbing a quick meal. Besides the pizza, you should also get a rotolo, which is really just a roll of pizza dough filled with ricotta and mortadella and it’s perfect.",/philadelphia/reviews/pizzeria-vetri,0.8594326207382919,1230
"A bunch of restaurants and bars in the city carry Tired Hands beer, but they usually only have one or two types, and if you want the full list, you have to travel 30 minutes deep into the suburbs. Fortunately, they opened a seasonal space in Fishtown, where they’re selling their whole repertoire in what used to be an abandoned lot.

"Art In The Age is a weird concept that’s half bar and half store, which is actually pretty brilliant, because when else are you more likely to buy something than when you’re a few cocktails deep? Think of it as real-life Amazon, except instead of waking up to seven Prime packages on your doorstep, you’ll find yourself in a cab at 6pm with four shopping bags full of artisan beef jerky and those big circular ice cube molds. It’s generally not super crowded, and it holds normal commercial store hours (aka it closes around 7 most nights), but it’s a good place to take a friend from out of town when you want to walk around Old City and grab a few drinks, but not get too drunk to see the Liberty Bell afterwards.",/philadelphia/reviews/art-in-the-age,0.8606400927957022,642
"Twenty Manning is from the same people behind Audrey Claire, and is also right across the street from it. The menu is similar as well, with everything from a raw bar to a New York strip steak, but the biggest difference is that Twenty Manning has a bar. A really good bar.

During the winter, you can order everything to-go from the little window, and then run back to wherever you came from as fast as is possible without getting frostbite. But in the summer, you’ll want to stay awhile. There are bright red and yellow picnic tables scattered around the patio, and white string lights that come on when the sun goes down.

"Weckerly’s is an old-fashioned scoop shop on Girard in Fishtown, and it doesn’t get nearly as much foot traffic as it should, given how good the ice cream is. They specialize in small batches of seasonal flavors, like honeysuckle and cinnamon toasted oat, which means you don’t really know what you’re going to get when you walk through the door, but we’ve still never had a flavor that we don’t love. Probably the best thing they do here is their ice cream sandwiches, which change just about as often as their flavors do, and have ridiculous crusts made out of things like shortbread and coffee cake.",/philadelphia/reviews/weckerlys,0.8780168027012629,1346

They take reservations, so you can introduce your friends to their $5 Bloody Marys and their new favorite Sunday tradition all at once.",/philadelphia/reviews/heritage,0.8441934823185672,422
"Whether you’re looking for somewhere to host your office holiday party or get your five closest friends together to celebrate the summer solstice, Standard Tap has you covered. They have a great rooftop deck, plenty of rotating beers, and a fireplace for once winter hits. Split a few shared plates, like the garlic clams, and make sure to get at least one chicken pot pie to share (or 10 if you bring the whole company).",/philadelphia/reviews/standard-tap,0.8676548681934606,723
"You have some friends visiting from the west coast and all they know about Philadelphia is that it has “a lot of Italian mob restaurants, right?” After you’ve finished rolling your eyes, take them to La Locanda. They serve great red-sauce Italian food, it’s pretty inexpensive, and the staff is so friendly it will make your out-of-town friends rethink everything they saw on It’s Always Sunny. It’s also BYOB, so make sure you pick up a bottle of wine or three on your way there.",/philadelphia/reviews/la-locanda-del-ghiottone,0.8295058046399405,311
"A lot of sushi restaurants are either super expensive or they have bright fluorescent lights and sticky laminated menus that curl up at the corners. Fortunately, 1225 Raw is in neither of these camps. It feels kind of like an upscale lounge (with a back patio that has lots of large tables), but is reasonably priced and still condones your one friend’s sake bomb habit. Win-win.",/philadelphia/reviews/1225-raw-sushi-sake-lounge,0.8743648301594393,80
"Walking through the doors at Brauhaus Schmitz is like finding a portal to Germany, and their Brauer Bund Beerhall in the back is spacious enough for nearly any size party. The prices are reasonable, from pretzels to pilsners, but when you really want to impress, order the suckling pig. It requires two weeks advance notice, and a 12-person minimum, but it’s worth the hassle.",/philadelphia/reviews/brauhaus-schmitz,0.8632387296049805,983
"A night at Las Cazuelas is very simple. Bring a good bottle of tequila and they’ll handle the shrimp ceviche, Mexican street corn slathered in crema, and mango margaritas. The relaxed restaurant on Girard Ave. (that’s usually easy to walk into) is a great place to take a group of friends on a budget since their tacos cost under $15. Go for the suadero, as the braised steak is so tender and juicy that you might even forget to belt out “Happy Birthday” when it’s time.",/philadelphia/reviews/las-cazuelas,0.8702623218812401,320
"Trattoria Carina is in Fitler Square and you’ll feel the shift as soon as you cross 20th street. It’s a little quieter and less flashy than most places around Rittenhouse, but the food and cocktails are both great, and they have a lot of outdoor seating. It’s a good option for a weeknight date, or really any time you want to spend the night drinking Negronis and eating spaghetti with clams.",/philadelphia/reviews/trattoria-carina,0.8677403704243778,642
"At this Moroccan place in Society Hill, you get to recline on low couches while you eat things like spicy cumin chicken, eggplant and carrot salads, and Moroccan pastries. Reservations are a must, but between the prix fixe menu and their cash-only policy, splitting the check is easy.",/philadelphia/reviews/marrakesh,0.8107777624330186,823
"If you’re looking for a place to start a night out, Alma de Cuba on Walnut is a good choice. Try to get one of the cushy booths, and order a few ceviches. Or if you want something more substantial, get the skirt steak with black beans and tomato escabeche. They’ve also got a popular Happy Hour, complete with jazzy music and mojitos. And for the full trifecta, head across the street to Ashton Cigar Bar after dinner.",/philadelphia/reviews/alma-de-cuba,0.8384104022513444,1151
"There are plenty of old school red sauce places in South Philly, but L’Angolo is one of the best. They take reservations, which is a huge advantage, and with a few separate rooms in the back, they don’t mind if you bring a group and enough wine to have a good time. Plus, their menu is full of fresh pasta and seafood dishes that are easily big enough to share. For a little bit of both, get the spaghetti scoglio.",/philadelphia/reviews/langolo-ristorante,0.8743823070307464,820
"If you’re taking someone to Union Transfer, you probably know the list of food options nearby is overflowing like a Sheetz parking lot. But that’s why there’s Osteria. This spacious Italian spot on North Broad has a beautiful covered greenhouse that’s flowing with flowers and a long bar that makes it an easy place to drop in before a show. The cocktails, pizzas, and handmade pastas are all excellent–especially their creamy and earthy francobolli ravioli that’s packed with robiola cheese and topped with large trumpet mushrooms. But we’re also big fans of the wood-grilled chicken if you want something that won’t weigh you down once the show starts–especially if you're planning to hit the dance floor.",/philadelphia/reviews/osteria,0.8633455733515064,161
"When it comes to dining out as a group, everyone’s got an opinion. We get it, and have a full guide for such occasions. If you want to keep things simple though, Tinto is a solid option with plenty of different tapas to choose from, along with over 100 different wines. Head over during Happy Hour for $5 sangria and selected tapas at the bar on the main floor, or you can sit down for a full meal in the downstairs dining room.",/philadelphia/reviews/tinto,0.8085760624064207,886
"The core concepts of Village Whiskey are fairly simple: great bourbon and great burgers. If they excelled in these areas alone, we’d be happy. But when you add in bar snacks like deviled eggs and cheese curds, an entire section of the menu dedicated to pickles, and Nutella milkshakes, we’re all in. Just know that the place is small, so expect to wait.",/philadelphia/reviews/village-whiskey,0.8035931554824887,744
"Located inside The Rittenhouse Hotel, Lacroix is a little slice of old school Philadelphia opulence. Their brunch buffet includes oysters, foie gras s’mores, hand-carved salmon, and sausage bao buns, along with 20 other things you’ll never see served together at the same time again. It’s $75 per person, and great for anniversaries or visitors who are especially indecisive first thing in the morning.",/philadelphia/reviews/lacroix,0.8824878910489999,519
"The good: it’s your turn to plan date night. The less good: you completely forgot about this until the morning of. Luckily, you’re not too far from Southgate. They’ve got our favorite bibimbap in the neighborhood, and if you’ve reached the point in your relationship where you’re comfortable making a mess, order the bulgogi burger.",/philadelphia/reviews/southgate-philly,0.8481212786403798,498
"Dizengoff is essentially the fast-casual version of Zahav, with a bunch of different hummus plates and shakshuka on Sundays. There are locations across the city, but if you work in Center City, the Sansom Street location next to Abe Fisher should be your new default dinner option when you don’t feel like cooking or spending more than $15.",/philadelphia/reviews/dizengoff-center-city,0.8759172676964622,408
"Hummus, baba ganoush, colorful vegetable salads, Isot has all of these things, in a little BYOB spot off South Street. They serve tons of small plates, as well as a bunch of kebabs and a four-person feast that you should save for a special occasion, or a Wednesday. You know, live your life.",/philadelphia/reviews/isot-restaurant,0.8347329661544466,408
"If you strike out after trying to get a spot at the bar at Zahav and find yourself in the random and vaguely unpopulated area between Old City and Society Hill, there aren’t many great places within walking distance that you can just pop into. Fortunately, there’s The Olde Bar. It’s almost directly across the street from Zahav and you can get some oysters and a pretty great burger without much of a wait. Is it what you expected from your night? No, but it’s a lot better than sitting on the curb and ordering $200 in scarves from Amazon while you watch the minutes tick by.",/philadelphia/reviews/the-olde-bar,0.8832492134102163,429
"Philly has its fair share of restaurants in big, historic buildings, but most of them are white-tablecloth spots filled with people who look like characters from Clue. Porta is different. It’s the third location of an Asbury Park pizza shop and just like the first two, it’s fun. The walls of what used to be a furniture store are covered in graffiti, and the huge space is perfect for you to invite all of your friends, and then for them to invite all of their friends. After dinner, they even set up a dance floor, so you don’t have to split two Ubers six ways to get to a crowded bar in Fishtown.",/philadelphia/reviews/porta,0.8806870097063972,828
"When all your finance friends want to grab dinner in Rittenhouse, you might start Googling where you can donate plasma to afford an appetizer. Or you can just suggest Butcher Bar for that sweet spot of “nice for a weeknight” and cost-effective. Their menu is full of little twists on bar snacks, like confit duck wings, sloppy joe poutine, and house-made beef jerky. But if you come with enough people, order The Trough ahead of time. This giant wooden slab is topped with rotisserie chicken, house-made sausages, fries, and five or six other things that’ll give you a good sense of how medieval knights ate.",/philadelphia/reviews/butcher-bar,0.8813071116506374,302
"When you and your friends are heading to a show at Underground Arts, but need to eat before a night of dancing, Roy Pitz Barrel House - an enormous brew pub just down the street - is here for you. The colorful mural-covered space is full of communal tables, high tops, and bar stools and can handle just about any size party with room to spare. All of the upscale bar food they serve is good, but the burger and fried brussels sprouts are where you should start.",/philadelphia/reviews/roy-pitz-barrel-house,0.8867417170805604,790
"Tacconelli’s in Port Richmond is cash-only and BYOB, and reservations are a must as they don’t make more dough than is reserved in advance. The crust is thin and crispy, so don’t bother ordering more than two toppings per pizza (all the more reason to order multiple pies). Also, take the timing of your reservation as a “suggestion” and pack a cooler full of cheap wine and beer - this one-man show moves at its own pace.",/philadelphia/reviews/tacconellis-pizzeria,0.8161556230171763,681
"There aren’t too many places in the city where you can get a meal for less than the cost of your morning latte. Luckily though, there’s Manakeesh, which makes some of the best and most affordable Lebanese food in the Philly. They do all-day brunch, have a spacious dining area, and serve a buttery cashew baklava that you’ll want to stock up on before you leave. The dips and flatbreads are all excellent, but it’s hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.",/philadelphia/reviews/manakeesh,0.869542297245939,376
"Due to a mix-up at the post office, you’ve suddenly received all twelve bottles from your “wine of the month club” at once. Bring the case and some friends to Ekta on Girard, where you can put a dent in your wine surplus (it’s BYOB here) and eat some good Indian food at the same time. Between the big portions and family-style option, this place works especially well for big groups. Go with the biryani and the spicy Goan shrimp curry, along with some extra naan to mop up the sauce.",/philadelphia/reviews/ekta-indian-cuisine,0.8937791346953822,756
"Calling the La Colombe in Fishtown a “coffee shop” is kind of like carrying a Swiss Army knife and only using the tiny saw - it’s not wrong, but it sort of misses the point. This place feels more like a brewery than wherever you normally go for your morning latte, with lots of space, plenty of seating, and a full food menu to go with all of the coffee you could ever want. Stop in for breakfast or to pick up a sandwich after work when you suddenly remember you were supposed to go grocery shopping three days ago.",/philadelphia/reviews/la-colombe-fishtown,0.8599827352224286,405
"Loco Pez brings together two of our favorite things: a neighborhood dive and Mexican food. If you happen to come here on one of their dollar-taco nights, you’ll be able to eat, grab a PBR, and leave a tip for under $10. Avoid Happy Hour if you’re trying to skip the crowds and make sure you have cash (they don’t take cards), but rest-assured that the prices will be reasonable and the nachos plentiful any time you go.",/philadelphia/reviews/loco-pez,0.8546366734581184,117
"When your best friend is celebrating her dog’s birthday and you’re in charge of bringing the human treats, make a stop at Cake Life. It may be tough to choose from the display cases packed with things like pistachio kouign-amann and fruit tarts, but you can’t really go wrong. They are open until 10pm on weekends, host BYOB cake tasting events the second Saturday of each month, and the sugar cookies will go faster than your interest in how old the dog is turning.",/philadelphia/reviews/cake-life,0.8939873438665522,1344
"Maybe you’re having people over for the Eagles game, or maybe you’ve been craving wings since you smelled them at a bar the other night. Either way, Andy’s is the best place in Fishtown to go for fried chicken. Their double-fried recipe results in an audible crunch, and the sweet chili sauce adds just the right amount of heat. Call ahead, and make sure you stock up on paper towels on the walk home.",/philadelphia/reviews/andys-chicken,0.8433541073863486,207
"Flavors here range from somewhat classic (like chocolate salt malt) to borderline ridiculous (Earl Grey sriracha and cucumber dill come to mind), and if you’re feeling especially generous, pre-pay for a scoop on the Pay-It-Forward Board. You can specify the scoop’s recipient in any way you like, so gift one to “anyone named Jake” or “someone having a bad hair day” if you want to make a difference, one ice cream at a time.",/philadelphia/reviews/little-babys-fishtown,0.848041179283244,1163
"If you’re new to Fishtown and want to get a good feel for the neighborhood, have some friends meet you at Cedar Point. With one of the best (and biggest) deck spaces around, their location at a six-way intersection is the ultimate in people watching real estate. Feel free to set up shop for the day and continue ordering drinks and shared plates as your friends come and go. The buffalo wings served with fried Brussels sprouts and the pickle burger are both major crowd pleasers.",/philadelphia/reviews/cedar-point-bar-kitchen,0.8791973777064653,113
"The Spruce Street Tria Cafe - there’s another one in Rittenhouse - has our favorite outdoor seating in the area and is comfortably away from the chaos of Center City. Split some wine and cheese and if you need something to go with a second glass, the truffled egg toast is excellent.",/philadelphia/reviews/tria,0.8851417749290014,519
"When you’ve exhausted the scene on Second Street and you’ve aged out of the Piazza, Bardot Cafe is here for you. This place is a little more grown up, from the candle lighting and leather booths to the pots of mussels you’ll be eating, but it’s still a fun spot where you can either have a chill dinner or a big night. If food is more a bonus than a requirement, stick to drinks at the bar during Happy Hour, which features half-off draughts and $5 bar snacks.",/philadelphia/reviews/bardot-cafe,0.8678201625172244,498
"Finding the right one-two punch for dinner and drinks can sometime end up feeling more like an SAT question than anything resembling fun. Make things easy and share some Ethiopian food at Abyssinia before you head upstairs to Fiume. This tiny dive bar specializes in rare beers and whiskey and feels more like you’re drinking in a friend’s apartment than an actual bar. If you’re looking for the rare one-two-three punch, they also have live bluegrass on Thursday nights.",/philadelphia/reviews/fiume,0.895965841628473,779
"Burg’s Hideaway is a small bar in Point Breeze where the menu reads like a slightly upscale seaside snack shack (think miso salmon and rice cakes and sake steamed mussels). The cocktails are strong and affordable, the lighting is dim, and they’ve got a weekend brunch if you’re looking for a day date.",/philadelphia/reviews/burgs-hideaway-lounge,0.897624555339367,941
"If your date’s the type that does all of their shopping at farmers’ markets and always talks about wanting to “explore bee keeping,” then there’s a good chance they’ll like Pumpkin. This small BYOB’s menu changes daily based on what’s in season, but if you see any type of crudo on the menu, make that the first dish you order. It’s cash only, so hit the ATM before you go.",/philadelphia/reviews/pumpkin-restaurant,0.8569263686452059,883
"No matter the weekend or the weather, Day by Day always seems to have a line. They’re only open from 9:30am to 2:30pm, so the window for brunch is a little tighter than some other spots in the city. They also don’t take reservations, but they do have very friendly service, a rotating assortment of stuffed French toasts, and potato pancakes with smoked salmon. Stick with the more classic American brunch dishes and skip the huevos rancheros for once.",/philadelphia/reviews/day-by-day,0.8781520566762093,1054
"There are mornings you feel invincible. You know, meditation at sunrise, early morning yoga, post-class juice. And then there are mornings where the only thing you want is a plate of cheesy eggs and potatoes, served with a side of more fried things. On mornings like this, Sam’s is here for you. This Bella Vista institution has been around for more than two decades, and though it’s nothing fancy on the outside, the service and food are consistently great.

"Scrolling through your stories the morning after a night out, you might have a few regrets. But as someone probably once said, “There’s no better cure for a pounding headache than pho from a strip mall.” Ok, maybe we’re the ones who said that, but it’s only because each of us has walked into Nam Phuong a mess and walked out a fully functioning human being an hour later. The Vietnamese coffee is strong and everything on the menu seems to have a restorative effect, but especially the pho.",/philadelphia/reviews/nam-phuong,0.7962647834196194,913
